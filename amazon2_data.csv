3,"I bought this for a 12 month old outgrowing her infant seat and have used it for a couple of months. I don't know how it will be with a larger child. It is nicely enclosing for a small child, and the higher base makes it easier for a baby to see out the windows. Both of these benefits could end up being drawbacks with a bigger kid. I like the headwings for comfort and possible increased safety. The cover has the feel of an upholstered seat, rather than just a car seat cover. The harness/headrest adjustment is ridiculously easy, just pull up on a headrest tab, and everything moves up, and there is a pad covering any openings in the back, so there are no temptations for little fingers to dig into the mechanism or seat foam. Installation is also very easy. I switch this car seat to a caregiver's car once a week, and it is just a matter of loosening straps, undoing the latch, and then redoing it. I haven't tried a seat belt install. The crotch strap has two positions, but the padding flap is sewn on, so it is not clear how it would work with the outer strap position. I chose this seat over passing on an old Radian in use by an older child because it seemed cushier and cozier for an infant and better for sleeping in, and, even though it was expensive, I will be OK with moving my child to a dedicated forward facing harnessed seat or a Radian when she is older if this seat isn't working well. I hope that its extra safety features add something, but as we all know, even the least expensive seats pass the same safety tests.<br />I'm editing this review to highlight a limitation of the seat. It does not seem to be good for tall babies. You can only use the lowest 7 harness positions for rear facing, and my daughter has been at the top one since about 15 months. I'm not sure how far I can let her shoulders get above the harness slots, but she is basically outgrowing this seat with its 45 lb RFing weight limit when she weighs about 25 lbs. She is longer than most (100th percentile), but I still figured I could RF her till at least 2 without worrying that she was outgrowing the seat. For my daughter, this seat turns out to have not been a good purchase.",X_train
4,"We are very picky about coffee and I'd never been able for some reason to make an awesome cup of coffee....finally...this coffee is fantastic!<br /><br />See...it wasn't me, it was the bad coffe I'd been using 😼",X_train
5,"I came across these crackers in a local market and decided to give them a shot. I had tried several other brands of rice crackers (ka-me, sesmark, back to nature), and they all have this distinct burnt rubber after-taste to them that I just cannot swallow. Not these! Diamond's have the most pleasant taste, and are really addicting. When I found these in the market, they were half the price of the other brands I mentioned. Not sure if this applies for all places.",X_train
6,"all new flavors with black, green and spice teas.  I think the price is well worth the trial of these teas.",X_train
7,Candy was real hard and not fresh. It was not the way it is suppose to be. Very disappointed. Love this candy by Brach's and was looking forward to enjoying an old time favorite.,X_train
8,Not good at all. Tasted stale.  Would never purchase again.  Awful quality and just bad taste. Would not recommend to anyone,X_train
9,"I have twins who generally like this toy. It has lots of sounds, lights, and everything a developing baby could want. However, I am giving this product three stars because its easy for tiny baby fingers to get trapped between the sun and the tab that changes the settings. We eventually had to tape it down to prevent anymore injuries.",X_train
10,These bids are great!! they wash amazing and look adorable. My son did fugure out how to pull it off so many times I just dont use it,X_train
11,I bought this for my son's lunch.  I put warm water in it for 5 minutes and then add the food.  It stays warm until lunchtime and seems very durable.,X_train
12,"Found the candy not easy to eat, like it wasn't fresh, I just gave up on it. Its one of my favorite, but very disappointed with his brand.",X_train
13,"even though i am not nursing, i am a first-time mom and i can't imagine sleeping well at night without this bassinet! the BEST feature is that you can see into to bassinet while laying in bed.  i can't tell you how many times i have reached in and placed the pacifier back into my son's mouth @ 3:00am and then rolled over to go back to sleep.  no getting up- no worries as to why he is fussing.  i can see right in and i know he is alive and well.  the light/music and most importantly vibration unit is also great.  vibration is key because my son goes right back to sleep when i put it on.  i read that babies are soothed by vibration and my son loves it.  i have no trouble w/ the sheets smelling, fitting or washing (which worried me because the other reviewer said she had a problem)- and it was really easy to put together.  i have reccomended to all of my friends- nursing or not.",X_train
14,The first 3 nights with my newborn baby I hardly slept. I kept having nightmares that I would find him dead in his cot. Then I bought this product and have slept wonderfully since - well as good as you can sleep with a baby! This product is very reasonably priced and I would have paid so much more for it. I have no complaints and my baby is now 5 months old.,X_train
15,"My husband loves unfrosted Blueberry Pop tarts. This product is difficult, at best, to find in any store so I decided to order them through AMAZON to get the product when I want to receive it, but the last order was delivered 12/22/13 (Sunday) and when I opened the box the very first box of Pop tarts had no Pop tarts in it. I have been unable to find a method of contacting responsible parties, so I am writing this review. Beware. You may not get what you paid for. I will search for what I need.",X_train
16,"These bars are dry and crumbly.  They are almondy and taste ok, but you need something to drink with them with EVERY bite.  And don't try to dip them because they will dissolve :)",X_train
17,A friend and I went to the manufacturer's website and ordered it there. Its half the price for the same size and they have a 5 pack there. As far as taste goes. I love love love my creamer in my coffee. I have to have it. I'm on a low carb diet and have been using heavy cream for my coffee for a while that does work but sometimes you want a bit of variety that being said I love the fact that this has zero cals or carbs. OMG I dont know how they make this stuff but Im thinking coco powder and magic. =)- but i will be ordering again but not from amazon sadly to much money.,X_train
18,This was a great buy for me..  Cheaper than the store and it came in a timely manner..  Thanks,X_train
19,These cloth diapers are wonderful.  Highly recommend.  They are becoming more and more popular and we love the selection available on Amazon.,X_train
20,"I'm a tea drinker and I love loose tea.  I've tried several types of tea balls and even bought my own cloth tea bags.  I can tell you this tea infuser really is the Ultimate.  It's so easy to use: just put infuser in your cup, add the loose tea into the infuser and pour the boiling or hot water over.  I use the little metal cap over the tea while it's steeping to keep the heat from drifting out and then I use it to set the infuser in when I take it out of the cup to keep any additional water from getting on the table.  I love this product and it's price is the best on Amazon.",X_train
21,"After our Safety 1st monitor bit the dust last week, we had to rush out and buy a new one.  So far, we have had no problems.  The phone does not interfere with it, nor do I have any of the random beeps or static that I did with our old monitor.  My only real complaint is that the base on the Parent's Unit is very narrow, causing us to have to prop it up at times.  It is quite unstable.  But, I really like the fact that the batteries on the parent's unit are rechargable.  I was used to chewing through 4 AAA batteries a week with the other one.  Also, the range on the parent's unit is wonderful.",X_train
22,"Bought this for my 11 month old son as a xmas stocking stuffer, but when he saw it, he wanted to play with it right away.  It is a big hit because if you push car back it winds up and takes off and he just laughs seeing the car move.<br />Great buy.  Looking for more colors.",X_train
23,"The bottles are great! They heat up nicely, they look great, they feel good (the silicone sleeves keep your hands from burning!) in your hand, and my lo loves them!  The only complaint I have is the openings of the bottles.  I wish they were bigger to make it easier to get scoops of formula into the bottles.  That is really the only thing keeping me from giving these 5 stars.",X_train
24,"I purchased these chips for my mobile vending cart. Because I have Amazon Prime the cost per bag is really good as far as a reseller goes. Each flavor is really good in its own right. These chips the Asian Sweet and Spicy are just so tasty. Its just the right amount of sweet and the slightest bit of spice that makes these a fantastic tasting chip.<br /><br />Lets talk about details:<br /><br />Chip thickness (+)<br />These are gourmet chips and the quality is there from the moment you open the bag. Each one is crunchy and not too thick but just enough to let you know you didn't buy a bag of Lays.<br /><br />Grease (+)<br />These are NOT greasy chips. Depending on the flavor they are just mildy seasoned and not coated in a heavy grease or oil.<br /><br />Flavor (+)<br />Each flavor stands completely on its own. You could do a blind taste test of each one of these flavors sold by Deep River and I bet you could tell what it was. None of the flavors are overpowering except maybe the Jalapeno flavor which is honestly too hot and I love hot food.<br /><br />Resale (+)<br />You may not resell these but at the current price and using Prime shipping the cost per bag allows you to make a decent profit.<br /><br />Overall:<br />These are great tasting, unique flavored chips that are hands down better than the ones you can get in bulk at a Sams or BJ's. Do yourself a favor and try a bag or two. I bet you'll love em like we do.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.",X_train
25,My son eats so many of these organic squeeze packets.  He seems to love this flavor.  I have it on auto subscribe and love the savings!,X_train
26,This works with LATCH and for the price it is awesome.  Does the job!!!!  I highly recommend this product.,X_train
27,I use boullion  cubes for soup stock because I can keep them in the cabinet and they impart a very good base for what ever else I'm making like soup or stew or a rice dish. McCormick Brand Spices has improved in quality quite a bit. This boullion is fresh when I receive it and has a good flavor.,X_train
28,Easy transition from Bottle to sippy cup. My son is picky with his milk bottle and when he saw this it was a perfec match!,X_train

33,"We were not interested in buying any stroller but the BOB Revolution Duallie until I started checking out the +one's features.  We had a BOB Revolution Single for our one child and loved it.  The +one has almost the same footprint (slightly larger) as the single BOB, but can accommodate two children- one can even be laying down.  We are a one stroller family, meaning a stroller has to be able to fit all circumstances including running trails and roads, walking busy sidewalks, cruising the airport, etc.  We were out and about in this stroller within days of our second child's arrival.  It worked great since our toddler could sit up front and our newborn could be completely flat.  Within 5-6 weeks we were able to run with both kids in tow.  We were able to switch our infant to an upright position at around five months as we continued to run 3-5 times a week.  (I'm not sure this is recommended, but our son was pretty strong from an early age and his neck was more than able to support his head even while bouncing around a bit).<br /><br />It collapses fairly easy, although ours gets stuck sometimes.  It won't store as small when you are using it for an infant and toddler because of the bassinet-type insert.  It should be noted that my toddler is very large for her age and quite picky, but she will switch from the front seat to the back and back again without caring that her legs must be very bent to fit in either seat.  (This was a big concern for me before purchasing the stroller).  The sun shade is huge and awesome.  The storage below is roomy.<br /><br />It does not go over the bumps quite like our BOB would, but I don't think that the +one is actually considered a jogging stroller and I am also comparing a single stroller to a double stroller.  Overall, this is a great stroller and I almost wish that it had been around when we were searching for a single stroller knowing that we were going to have kiddos fairly close together (22months apart).",X_train

37,"Great potty.  Especially for boys. Most other potties he would pee out of the potty, but this works and holds it in.  Love the back support too,  He is really hyper and the back support hugs him so it has a calming effect.  Only negative thing, is that the potty is small and my son is 3 years, he is a big boy.  I wish they made this bigger.  I would get it anyway!",X_train

41,I have made it most of the way through sample pack and so far I have been happy with it. Except the apple pie a la mode. I had nightmares about that flavor for two nights and anytime I catch a whiff of that smell they reoccur. I hesitate to try the banana foster for the same reason.,X_train

45,"Cute little book for baby.  Lots of nice noises, pages crinkle, rattle, squeek, etc.  Bright colors and different textures that baby will love.  Like all Jellycat products this seemed like is was designed just for my little guy!  You can see in the picture that this book has a little loop so you can attach it to stroller, shopping cart, etc....the loop has velcro so you can attach it easily LOVE this!

50,"Our bedroom is literally less than 20ft away from our daughters room, on the same floor. Right across the hall. We have to have her monitor as close to her door as possible, and ours is as close to our door as possible, and still, the reception is HORRIBLE, it constantly cuts out and back in as if I'm at max range. We have to adjust it often just to make sure it's in some perfect position that it might work all night long without cutting out completely and making the loud buzzing noises to let us know it's not working. We have the same problem with our parent unit we keep downstairs, horrible reception and occasionally decides to stop working all together! For such a pricey piece of equipment, it is HORRIBLE. Wish I would've saved my receipt. Never buying electronics from this company again.",X_train
51,These tasty wonton chips are great for salads! Individual serving bags keeps them fresh until you need to use a bag or two.,X_train
52,"This was easy to assemble, but once done, it's a little flimsier than most. A selling point of this bassinet is that it's portable but once you scoot it from one room to another more than a few times, the legs get a little wobbly.    Also, the \\""pin\\"" that is supposed to keep the cradle in place falls out too easily, and catches against the wood, which of course scratches it.     Another time, the pin goes in, but the pin is so thin that the cradle moves about. So if baby rolls to the side, he will be on a slight incline, which may wake him up because the pin comes out so easily and is the wrong girth. Also, my son got his foot stuck through the slats.",X_train

56,"I bought four frames as Xmas gifts and can tell you it's been an uneven experience.  By no means am I a crafty mom, the main reason I bought the product was because it's not only \\""easy to use,\\"" but it doesn't look cheap.  The frame is lovely, and I appreciate the molding?/cutouts that will frame the actual photo/print.    The first try was a mess, and it took a few frustrating tries for the lightbulb to go off and get a successful imprint.  The rolling pin is useless as the clay stuck to the thing immediately.  So I flattened it out to a reasonable dimension w/ the palm of my hand.  Then I stuck my kid's hand into the clay, and the clay stuck to her hand terribly, ruining the imprint every time I tried to remove her hand.  Frustrating!  Why did it stick to her hand while not sticking to mine as I rolled it....?  Aha! Slightly dense, I know, but it finally occured to me that I should roll it on her no-longer-willing hand a little bit before sticking it into the clay for the umpteenth time.  Moderate success!  Exhausted, I put off the other 3 prints for the next day.      Feeling wiser and more confident, I set out to complete the project the following rainy afternoon. Seeing the stuff, my kid knew what was up and tried to hide behind her dad.  Happily, the following two imprints breezed by with nary a cry nor a curse.  Success within my grasp, I confidently ripped open the fourth and final package and met what nearly became my Waterloo.  The stuff stuck to me bad.  Words can't describe the panic-inducing mess as I struggled to free myself of this thing that was like wet bread dough and taffy rolled into one.  What had happened?  Was I really so arrogant?  Couldn't the gods let me have this one win?  For the entire length of time it took for my fella to win an online Halo match I struggled.  Concerned, my child offered to help me, but I would not sacrifice my offspring to this horror.  If I went down, I wanted my kid to live the rest of her life knowing her mommy's sacrifice every time she saw the empty shadow box on the wall.  I finally managed to scrape the stuff off my hands--I guess after 20 minutes' worth of air time, it finally hardened into something that was almost manageable.   Afraid of being trapped again, I put a light coating of olive oil on my hand to flatten out the clay.  Fearing for my kid's psyche, I did the same for my daughter, and I must say the image was the best one yet.  I don't know if any discoloration will result, but I figured I might have the kid paint them when ready.      Easy?  Sometimes, but this product is definitely not for the weak.  You've been warned.",X_train
57,I prefer the ergo and my husband prefers the mei tai but I use it at times as well. It's really nice to both.<br />But for me since I'm a petite frame the straps are too long and the knot formed at my low back bothers me or too much extra fabric hangs down. This is partly why is works better for my husband. He loves it.,X_train

60,"I'm writing this at 3:30 am because this poorly designed product has the regrettable feature of keeping me up all night.  For some reason they designed the emitting unit so it is pretty much a five inch block of bright blue glowing light.  It literally lights up the entire room at night when I am trying to sleep.  There is no way to dim the light.  And now it is starting to flicker incessantly all night.  I can not understand why they would make a product that would be used at least 12-hours a day in darkness as a night light.  It is very frustrating.  The receiving end is also very bright in my child's room.  Perhaps I am just a light sleeper but then please consider this if you are one, too.",X_train
61,"These gummy worms are awesome!  They came super fresh and were perfectly gummy for my wedding candy bar.  When you can get the bag this large the price goes down per pound drastically.

64,"I am generally a Seattle's Best coffee fan, but this competes well and is a bargain compared to some higher priced brands. The first bag impressed me with really oily fresh beans. The smell was somewhat off-putting when opening the bag for the first sniff. However the first batch through my French press was delicious! Upon sharing this with a few colleagues at work, the opinions were favorable. We like our coffee dark & strong with no acidity. Cafe Altura French roast is a winner and will also produce a fine espresso or a stout iced coffee. Okay- this is an update to the above: Upon trying an espresso grind, the coffee is still tasty but the oily beans finally killed my cheap burr grinder! If you are going to have freshly roasted, dark roasted, oily beans coffee, then use an inexpensive chopper-grinder or invest in a commercial grade, conical burr grinder.

69,"Best stroller yet.  I have three kids, two under the age of four, and have bought way too many strollers.  This is not the most expensive stroller I have purchased, but to date it has the best build quality, rolling characteristics, and ease of opening and closing.  It is larger than the four wheel umbrella types and some others when folded up, that is what you get with a jogging style three wheeler.  If this were lost I would immediately replace it.  Keep those umbrella strollers for the occasional dash to the supermarket, but for your intentional longer walks, trips through the shopping mall or just strolling, this is the one we prefer.",X_train
70,"This is terrific coffee for the price. How they can sell an expensive varietal coffee like Yirgacheffe(some of the best coffee in the world IMHO & many coffee writers)for these prices is a mystery. The roast is right in the middle so people who like the \\""Charbucks\\"" roast(which I do) may be slightly disappointed but I found plenty of good flavor in this, didn't really miss the dark roast. The icing on the cake is the wonderfully fast delivery time-my package's roasting date was 4 days before I got it!! Can't really improve on that unless you have a roaster in your neighborhood. Buy it direct from FRC, same price, freshest delivery!",X_train
71,"overall i really like this blanket a lot and i have used it regularly to help keep my baby warm but due to the relative thickness/stiffness of the material i tend to use it as you would a regular blanket (i.e. simply laid on top of sleeping baby) vs. as a swaddling blanket. it's also great for laying out flat to protect baby from surfaces and vice versa (e.g. floor, couch, bed, etc.) and i absolutely love the subtle color/pattern due to my minimalist, modern stylistic preferences.<br /><br />for swaddling my husband and i preferred to use the muslim cloths (e.g. aden + anais) as they were thinner/more flexible/had more stretch - for us they worked better to really cocoon our baby snugly as she is a little houdini and wrapping her in the swaddledesigns receiving blanket didn't work well at all. while the material is actually more similar to what they were using in the hospital it just didn't work well for us to keep her contained and wrapped up. also, our apartment tends to run warm vs. cool even though we live in a very cool-year-round city so the heavier flannel also was a touch too warm for swaddling use.<br /><br />that being said, i do still highly recommend this blanket because as already mentioned, it has a ton of other uses and is made from good quality material and has a great overall design. it holds up beautifully through multiple washes and i know i will be able to use it for many years to come for my baby. when we were still swaddling her we would use this one as an extra layer when needed on top (the hospital always swaddled her twice, we just swaddled once and then placed a second layer over her in her bassinet) and now that she's past needing to be swaddled i use it as a lighter blanket for crib naps during the day - the material is soft enough to be against baby's skin but stiff enough that i'm not concerned about it being a suffocation hazard in any way.",X_train

93,"I drink a ton of Matcha, and have tried just about everything under the sun that claims to be ceremonial grade. Many fall horribly short of the mark. Was on DoMatcha and Matcha Ippuku which were working really well for me... until I found this.<br /><br />This is the sweetest most well balanced matcha I've ever tasted straight, short of permutations that cost $60 per ounce. The color is fresh and vibrant, again the best I've seen retail. It holds an ultra fine froth for an absurd amount of time, to the point that it feels like you are drinking a creamy beverage when there is no milk present. Properly prepared in the right concentration, it is almost like you are drinking a properly served Guinness.<br /><br />Packaging is great. No annoying pouch inside. Pop the top and the powder is there, waiting for you to dig in.<br /><br />Cooking with matcha and making matcha lattes is all fine and good, but do that with your second harvest stuff. Consuming this as anything less than a straight up cup of tea doesn't do the product justice.<br /><br />Yes, it is that good.",X_train
94,"I did quite a bit of online research before purchasing this BEE for my 20 month old daughter. I have been wanting to get a ride-on toy for some time, something she could use inside. We got the LARGE version (she is currently 24 lbs and average height) and was given to her as a 'prise' one morning. She immediately got on it, and started wheeling around. Each day she rides on it around the house and is always saying 'BEEE.\\""     Last week, her grandmother bought her an electric Dora car, which she did enjoy. But after riding it a few times, she got off, pulled out her BEE and started riding on it. She likes the Dora electric car, but LOVES the Bee. I highly recommend it as a non-plastic, very friendly toy and I wish I had gotten even a few months earlier.    UPDATE: 1/26/2010. Our daughter is now almost 2.5 years old. We had rain rain rain over the last few weeks so had one of our playgroups meet at an indoor mall. All the kids brought their ride on toys. Kettler push bikes, Radio Flyer, you name it. Every kid wanted to ride THE BEE. The little girls all around 2 years old took turns on it -- my daughter became quite upset because she wanted to ride it too and sharing at this age is more of a concept than reality.

It makes good sense to use your own coffee beans and avoid the cost of the pre-filled commercial K-cups you buy at the store.  Now, I received my DisposaKups over a month after ordering them and put them to use.  I was immediately disappointed, filters did not hold very much coffee, It was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup.  The coffee was very weak.  This product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made K-cups. The body and lids are plastic.  Normal K-cups do not have a plastic lid.  Notice they say 100% disposable....So put them in the trash. They are not recyclable = landfill.  They are not convenient, they are a bit messy, a pain to put together and still expensive.  Not worth it! There are better alternatives out there that will save you money, make better coffee and not go into a landfill.   Sorry, I wish I had better news, I think I will return these.",X_train

The dresser is sturdy (become less so in time, but still okay) and besides some scratches in the wood it looks okay.  However, I would not recommend to buy this dresser because of the poor design. The gap between the top horizontal bars is an accident waiting to happen. A leg (or a chubby knee in my son's case) can get stuck in the gap. In our case we needed to take the upper bar apart to release the knee....   I admit I did not pay attention to this till now, because our older son was always so relaxed during diaper change. But our younger son is everything but relaxed.. and already managed to get his knee badly stuck in the gap.. I'm now looking for a new dresser with a better design.

125,"Krave cereal is an interesting concept.  Kellogg's seems to be targeting both kids and parents with the promise of whole grains as well as a chocolate center, plus somewhat unique branding for a broader appeal.  This is in contrast to Special K Chocolatey Delight which is aimed at grown-ups or Froot Loops which is marketed to kids.<br /><br />From an appearance and texture standpoint, the cereal consists of little pillow-shaped bites with a small amount of \\""chocolate spread\\"" inside each one.  Without milk, they are fairly crunchy, but after adding milk, the oat content (and lack of a waxy milk-resistant coating) makes it easy for them to start to get soggy in much the same way that Quaker Oat Squares do, with the outside layer becoming soft first.  When eating it, the texture is just slightly course, perhaps on purpose to highlight the whole grain content, but not unpleasantly so.<br /><br />Flavor is rather oat-like with some sweetness and a touch of chocolate flavor.  I would describe it as similar to Oat Squares, but smaller and with a little less crunch, plus the added chocolate.  It's different, but can kind of grow on you, and kids seem to like it.  The box was gone quite quickly.<br /><br />I like the cereal, but would prefer to see a little bit higher fiber content per serving and perhaps a touch less sugar.  3g fiber is the same as Multi-grain Cheerios, but Oat Squares has 5g per serving.  It's actually very close in both fiber and sugar content to Froot Loops, surprisingly.<br /><br />Overall, I would describe Krave as a cross between Oat Squares and Cap'n Crunch (and somewhere between the two in size), plus a touch of chocolate.  If the way that Oat Squares get soggy from the outside in bothers you, you probably wouldn't like Krave, but otherwise I think most people who like oat-based cereals and chocolate would enjoy it.  Kids like it too, so it might be a reasonable option if your kids are sick of Chocolate Cheerios or Life Cereal, and with about the same or a little more fiber (though also a little more sugar).",X_train

132,"If you like Special K cereals in general, you're probably going to like this.  The strawberries are the same dried wafers that they use in their regular strawberry cereals, no big surprise, and which I've always thought were a little tart for my taste.  The chocolate comes in tiny rectangles about an 1/8th of an inch wide and 1/2 an inch long, and taste like semi-sweet dark chocolate.  Together, they don't taste too bad - Special K has never been a very sweet cereal anyway, and even with the chocolate, its still pretty mild.<br /><br />If you look close at the picture on the front of the box, it shows a detailed picture of a bowl of this stuff, and it's pretty misleading.  The chunks of strawberry look like they just came out of a garden, and they chocolate looks much bigger than what you really get.  I don't suppose we should be surprised that a pictured designed to sell us cereal is less than honest, but still, I wish I had the bowl on the box rather than the bowl I ate this morning.<br /><br />The worst thing about this cereal (and again, it's really not that bad), is that the chocolate chunks tend to congregate toward the bottom, so when you pick up the bowl to slurp the milk out because all the flakes are gone, you'll find out where all the chocolate was that you thought you'd be getting THROUGHOUT the meal.  As I said, Special K really isn't that sweet of a cereal, so if the makers were depending on the chocolate being well-dispersed throughout the flakes to give it a little bit sweeter taste, they failed.  Instead, you'll get the taste of Special K for about 90% of the bowl, and a whole bunch of mini-chocolate bars at the end.  If you think of it as a reward for finishing your cereal, then I guess you'll do all right.<br /><br />Trust the Chief",X_train

Most of the problems were from 3rd party participants and UppaBaby CS has always been helpful which is why I continue to purchase their accessories/products. HOWEVER, I purchased this for our G-Luxe and the material/workmanship is horrible. Within a week the rain cover tore around the holes where you snap it in to the stroller at the bottom. I ordered it Dec 10 2011 and to day it's torn around all areas that have a velcro snap and the plastic has come undone in several places from the fabric lining. To pay another $25 for a replacement cover that will likely tear again in 30 days is just not worth it!! I am not careless with the cover either, I would take it off and fold it up nicely when it was not in use and it still disintegrated with normal wear and tear. I am going to look for a cheaper replacement. Uppababy should really come up with a more sturdy rain cover. Maybe it fits the G-lite better but at least for my stroller it just didn't hold up.",X_train

There are no artificial ingredients or preservatives in these nuts and, as a big added bonus, they are grown and packaged in the USA.

Putting in the trunk of a car often requires removal of front wheel (which is pretty easy)<br />- Not that durable. The seat folding bar snapped off on me at about the eight month mark and still I can't adjust the seat up or down without removing the fabric cover and manually adjusting it<br />- The basket sucks. If you put even something slightly heavy in it (like a sweatshirt), it will fall off the two small hooks on the side and land on the brakes, which engages them<br />-The sun shade could be bigger. I always feel like it's too far back or too far forward but there is no in between position<br /><br />If you are looking at this stroller you are probably thinking, like we were, that we want something reasonably priced that will grow with our child and allow us to do occasional more rough and tumble strolles on unpaved areas. We also don't live in a city but a suburb so the walking isn't as necessary - we usually walk a few times a day on our street, probably a mile or two a day, occasionally more if we go places like a mall or the beach or something. ANd it works for that.<br /><br />We are having a 2nd child now and are switching to a City Mini double stroller. It is much nicer than this one, but also costs almost $200 more - so it's up to your budget.

166,"These covers are, by far, the best covers we've used yet. Aside from the fact that you will need to buy larger sizes as the baby grows, they are super durable (3 layers of PUL rather than 1!) and lock-tight. We haven't had any leaks with these. Be sure to get the right size. If you have a skinny baby, go with the medium rather than by weight if you're trying to decided between medium and large. The low cost also makes these very affordable. These covers make up half of my diaper stash and the others are all pockets. I use these at night because the flexibility to stuff them more than I can the pockets. Great product!",X_train

177,"After suffering with purchasing many suction bulbs (6) different types, I wasn't able suction the poor thing until I looked online and behold the solution to my boogy problem was here! With arm and hammer normal saline spray for children, I would spray into each of my babies nostril and suction away. It was clearly heaven sent. For the winter season I use it everyday and with putting the heat up comes dry air making it easy for bacteria to get the little ones sick a lot quicker. Since two month olds don't have many options to medication, I went homeopathically the first time and now this time, and to help my baby recover, I used humidification with a vapor inhalant throughout the night, keeping him hydrated, cuddling, and suctioning. Remember these little babies are nose breathers so keeping an open airway for their nares is important to in the process of recovery. FYI the reason my little one got sick is because my two year old coughed and sneezed in his face and mommy was too late to avoid it. My two year old also probably got sick because he's frequently putting his hand in his mouth no matter how many times I tell him not to. So with the use of this thing, all the above,  hand washing, hand sanitizer, and Clorox wipes, you will be on the road to recovery. As for my two year old I have used hylands cold tablets and it helped him to recover. Now my next journey is to get elderberry to build his immune system and vitamin c gummies. Hope this helps. Sincerely from an RN and fulltime mommy.",X_train
178,"I ordered these as soon as our twin boys pulled up and started toddling. Even though they aren't tall enough to reach the door knobs, yet, I would rather not be surprised when they discover they CAN reach. The bonus confirmation came a couple of weeks later at the boys' birthday party. I saw a couple of our friends' 6-year-old children trying to get into our bedroom to search for \\""the missing cat\\"". They tried several times to squeeze and turn the knob, but couldn't get it to work and finally gave up. Well worth the investment, and our cat was happy, too.<br /><br />Seriously, this has been a superb product for us. We do live in a 1-year-old house with perfectly round doorknobs throughout. I don't think these would work as well on small or narrow door knobs or older, sticky doors.<br /><br />UPDATE -- Knocking off one star... These worked great through early toddling, reaching, and grabbing. But before the boys were 3 they figured out how to pop them by either whamming the door into the wall (no doorstops on most of our interior doors) or whacking the cover with something. We've switched most of the doors to latches that hold them slightly open. I still think this is the best version of this product, and the best value for money.",X_train

186,"We have several of Avent's 'regular' pacifiers at home, which my daughter likes and uses on a regular basis.  When I purchased these, the glow-in-the-dark feature was not important to me, as I really didn't expect the glow to last for long (c'mon folks, it's glow-in-the-dark - the technology hasn't improved much since 1985...haha).  As other reviewers have noted, the glow really does not last too long after the lights go out.<br /><br />I'm sure most parents who use pacifiers for their babies would agree with me on this - we have pacifiers floating all over the house, but it seems whenever you want one, none can be found.  For this reason, I did like the nighttime pattern on the pacifiers; it helps my husband and I to remember that those are the 'bedtime binkies' and when we find them around the house, to put them back into her bed, so we *always* have a pacifier for bedtime.  Yes, the base of the pacifier is larger than Avent's 'regular' design, but I find that the larger base prevents the pacifiers from falling through the slats on my daughter's crib, which happens to the 'regular' design frequently.  Perfect if she wakes in the night; she can find her binkie and replace it herself - which she does.  I'm really pleased with these, as I have been with all Avent products I have purchased.",X_train

We ultimately returned this version and purchased the smaller Peapod since our main objective is to use this as a bed for our 17 month old while traveling internationally and space is a huge concern.  This was large enough for me to get into, not comfortably of course but more to encourage our LO to get into it.  I am 5' 4'' and 110 lbs for a size reference.  Our LO has always been an &#34;easy&#34; baby and adjusts to new situations well so she was comfortable in this from the get go.  I'm not sure how other children would take to it but I would assume that once they got used to the idea, they would consider it fun.  The pad seems a bit thin but she didn't seem to mind it.  The pad on the Plus a bit thicker than the smaller version.",X_train

The intructions are extremely difficult (and we are intelligent people).  We have had it for a few months and every time we think we figured it out, we wake up and it didn't work, or the alarm went off, or the am and pm have been mixed up.  The only way to get the lighted background to work was to flip the whole clock up-side-down and prop it up because we cannot seem to fix the am/pm situation (even when we tried to reverse the whole operation).

203,"My baby is now 18+ months and I've been using these scissor to get her nails since she was only a few months old. I have never ever tried the baby nail cutters that are available (was given a pair, but it looked quite scary to use). These scissors weren't intimidating at all to hold or use. So far, I've found them very easy to use; no mishaps (yet). I find cutting the nails the most easy after giving my baby a bath (this is true for adults too) as the nails are nice and soft, therefore cutting away very easily.<br /><br />There's a slight curve to these scissors - useful for placing the flat part at the finger tips and allowing for a single continuous cut across the nail. The ends of the scissors are rounded, a good safety feature, especially when my little one starts to squirm around. The cover/sheath is nice to have to cover the scissors when not in use, but also as a nice distraction for the little one when I take the scissors out to cut nails.<br /><br />Lastly, the scissors seem to remain sharp despite my regular use. Wonderful!<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend everyone to give these a try.",X_train

225,"This was the easiest baby accessory I ever installed. It came packaged flat and compact. All you have to do is unfold and figure out that the rubberized ends below the table top grips wind up and down - BINGO.<br /><br />We have a wooden French kitchen style dining table - unfortunately it would not fit around the majority of the table, so beware: If you have a lip like mine that is fairly thick (not the distance from the table edge to the lip but that the lip block itself is thick +3.5cm) then it won't fit in that little U-shaped space properly. Also it says on the package that if your lip is more than 3.5cm away from the edge it won't fit either - at least not safely. Luckily enough our table has two curved ends where there is no lip at all and it fit just perfectly there.<br /><br />I bought the beige (Fiordilatte) because I did not want a super bright color - my baby's toys and such are taking over the decor anyway. I was a little concerned it may be a little too light but so far it is great - not too light to show all the stains and not too dark to be frumpy. The cover comes off anyway and can be machine washed - it wipes easily too.<br /><br />It has two little slot clips on the arms (on the aluframe just under the textile before the table top grips) so you can 'easily' clip the chair on and off without unscrewing - that system makes no sense since it is much easier to un-clamp/-screw and leave the grips on the chair, than to un-clip (putting it back in was a major exercise in finger strength pushing those little clips back in). I just have it as a permanent installment though so I don't care much for taking it on and off unless we have a big party around for dinner.<br /><br />My baby is only 5 months old and just only figured out how to sit up. He was sitting in this thing was before he learned to hold himself upright. This is because it is just the right size and padded really nicely both on the backrest as well as the cover for the clips in the front. Thecanvas base/bottom seems flimsy at first you think 'will it hold?' but in actuality it is great because it is thickly padded and gives way just enough to feel soft, yet pretty sturdy. The belt is secure and easy to use (I love the padded covering so it is more comfortable when the little one leans forward to eat), though for now our little guy seems secure in the seat without them; but that may be just because he doesn't know to try and climb out yet.<br /><br />It is so small and compact, and blends in so well, it is entirely unobtrusive. I do think however that if he grows a lot more he won't fit any more - it seems like it won't work for the 15mth-olds I know. However, since we will likely have him sit in a proper chair with an addition with belt or such when he is too big for this, rather than a separate high chair, this is a great little piece of equipment that does not take up any space and has him sitting at the table with us at dinner playing around without much of a fuss at all. Golden!<br /><br />UPDATE: My little man is now 22 months old and still uses this - so I guess I was wrong and this may be the only high chair we ever have to buy since it goes up to 35lbs and he is just under 30lbs now. One tip - we now have a food mat under the grips (not recommended for safety but never impacted the grip on our table).",X_train

Just don't succumb to using it on everything!  You'll be tempted.",X_train

251,"My wife's father, who retired a few years ago, was a potato farmer. He knows a thing or two about potatoes. When he was operating the farm, he sold most of his potatoes to Frito-Lay where they ended up as Lay's Potato Chips. He would always \\""test\\"" the new crop of potatoes by making his own potato chips. He'd use a mandoline slicer to create nice thick slices of potato and then would deep fry them. A couple minutes later there would be these awesome, thick sliced, perfectly cooked chips which then got a sprinkling of salt. Best chips I've ever had.<br /><br />Sorry for that long story, but these Gradma Utz Handcooked Potato Chips taste just like the chips my Father in law makes. They are awesome. They hold up to thick dips without cracking and breaking like some other well known \\""thin\\"" chips do. I don't think chips could be much better than these.",X_train
252,"For me, these tasted terrible.  The kale chips are so dry, they turn to powder in my mouth. And the ranch flavor does very little to help the over powering kale flavor.",X_train

254,"This tea smells and tastes like tea that has a lemon slice put into it. The pyramidal design lets the leaves expand and float freely inside the bag, allowing for more of the tea flavor to diffuse. The downside is that the bag is made of nylon or some kind of plastic mesh, making it non-biodegradable. The pyramids are also just boxed together, not individually sealed for freshness.<br /><br />The black tea taste does seem weaker than the traditional flat Lipton tea bags. Maybe I've had the box open for too long (but it's well before the Best Before date of 10/24/11), or it's being masked by the lemon juice concentrate and marigold petals. For iced tea (with honey), however, I can't really complain about the taste. If you don't have real lemons around, this is a good alternative.<br /><br />Curiously, modified corn starch is listed as an ingredient. I don't know what this additive does for tea and it's the first tea product I've seen it in.<br /><br />One bag 110mg of flavonoid antioxidants and 55mg of caffeine.",X_train

257,"This review is for the Red Edition (cranberry). No funny aftertaste! I just had a nice, frosty can of this and chugged it down in about 2 minutes (hey, I was thirsty). I started to get the same caffeine buzz I get when I have a 7 oz cup of coffee (and the caffeine's about the same = 80 mg). My preference is for sugar free beverages of this type because some of the \\""sugar\\"" ones are so sweet they hurt my stomach. Red Bull doesn't go overboard with the sweetness here. Yes, it is sweet, but not to the extreme end of some other beverages. The tanginess of the cranberry flavor was my favorite part.<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars for a product doing exactly what it says. Your taste buds may vary.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a free sample of Red Bull Red Edition (cranberry) for testing purposes.",X_train

267,"Having lived in Spain for almost six years, I know the importance of Saffron being kept in a glass jar. Having depleted the supply I'd brought back with me; I decided this product would be a suitable replacement. The moment I opened the shipping box, I could smell the Saffron! I knew I had something spectacular, but held off using it till I cooked a dish of Paella for a group of friends. The spice did just I felt it would, and more, imparting the lovely golden tint I love, and giving my dish a smokey taste. The mortar and pestle were perfectly sized, and I showed one friend how to use it; she was amazed! My friends had never had anything with fresh Saffron in it before, and were blown away by how wonderful it was. I will be ordering this again!",X_train

I felt bad getting my husband up almost every night to change sheets because I couldn't lean over and tuck in her clean sheets. These pads are awesome! They're soft, breathable, and are not crinkly or plastic. The sides are extendEd to be able to tuck them under the sides of the mattress. They totally hold liquid no problem. My daughter has h a few accidents on them and they absorb everything without anything running off the sides. More all I have to do is take of the pad, throw it in the wash and put on the new onen. No need to change all the bedding! GENIOUS!",X_train

These are way more expensive at whole foods so buy them here!",X_train
285,If you like coconut then you are in for a treat. It is not what I consider to be water as its a little thicker than 'juice'. It has lots of white cubed pulp inside..that is very tender and not like the sweet cocount you get in the supermarket.  You can drink and chew at the same time so its really a meal in a can.  Its also very healthy and so delicious a healthy substition for sodas.  Buy it!!!....but in your local supermarket as the price here is steep as well as the shipping.,X_train

The design of the animals themselves and the movements they make are what make this toy so good. Would recommend.",X_train
288,"I've got no complaints against the macaroni in this product. The product is designed to produce one bowl at a time of mac and cheese and the mac part comes out perfectly. I am still iffy on the cheese. Oh, I get that it's real. However, it's white, and it mixes with the starch water in such a way that... well, it's not appealing to look at. Even after adding a little butter. It tastes alright, but I cannot get past that weird, glue-like appearance. But a liberal dose of hot sauce later, it's easier to look at and quite palatable. This product is pretty convenient if you want a single serving of mac and cheese without a lot of additives, but in future I think I'll just boil a little elbow macaroni and melt some Muenster over it.",X_train
289,I chose this rating because the product was good. My only complaint is that one the Miracle Noodle was cut in the middle and was leaking out water when I had open the box.

295,"I found these to be the most economical solution to keeping our child from reaching in the toilet bowl and also works for our lazy susan where other products cost about twice what one of these costs.  It's very simple to use and I'm not convinced that the other products &#34;specialized&#34; for toilet seats, etc.. would be any easier to use or more effective.  Our 16 month old still hasn't figured these out and probably won't till he's at least over two.  I haven't tried it yet, but I would think that you could probably even scrape the sticky tape off of these, get more sticky tape from a hardware store, and reuse them again in other locations if you wanted.  We've been using them for 2 months so far.  If our experience changes, I'll update this.",X_train

The chocolate chip cookie dough LARABAR is a relatively safe food for me, even during a mild flare.<br /><br />The ingredient list: Cashews, dates, chocolate chips, and salt.<br /><br />The cashews aren't ground completely into a nut butter. There are some small cashew pieces, which may present a problem for some. The flavor is pretty good, and the chocolate is usually strong enough to overcome mild off-flavors from medications (think metallic tasting antibiotics). The calorie density is such that a few of these allow me to keep my weight up. They're a great source of fat. (Not so much protein though.)",X_train

It fits discreetly in my diaper bag or glove compartment.",X_train

My son is very curious and is so stimulated by all that is around him - especially with my other two children buzzing around him and getting in his face.  I was looking for anything to help my son get to sleep, especially since we are always on the go and sometimes he needs to sleep wherever we are at.  With this cap, I just drop the shade and he calms down, and after a very short while, he falls asleep - anywhere!  I am sure it won't work for all babies, but if it might work for yours, it is worth a shot!  Sleep if precious for little ones (and for us!)",X_train

It did take 2 days or so for my son and I to get it fitting right and get the hang of getting him in.  Those 2 days were honestly a little frustrating.  I hear that is pretty standard with all slings.  But once we found our way, this sling was perfect.  So comfortable and simple in design.  I honestly couldn't have made a better choice.<br /><br />And just for the heck of it, I did try the Moby wrap.  What a nightmare.  I wouldn't wish that mess on any sleep deprived new mommy.",X_train
363,We absolutely love the stroller. We we're very hesitant on spending that kind of money but after using it a couple times you can see why you pay a little extra to get the quality. It is so easy to push it practically goes itself and it turns on a dime. One of the main reasons I chose the stroller over the BOB is that it's very simple to use has everything you need. (I Wasn't getting it for jogging) it's extremely easy to fold up which is one of the things you're going to be doing a lot so I felt that that was high on my priority list. The other thing is it folds up very slim especially if you take off the wheels which is great when we have the car packed up traveling. There are a few things I wish were a little different. Like some of the reviews said the seats are a bit reclined back I wish they sat up further. Also the stow away strap that keeps it closed is a bit difficult to feed through the bracket. I wish it was a bracket style like some other brands. The best way to store it in my garage is on its side in the wheels. There's no other way with out it following over.,X_train

My son, however, learned how to escape the Bumbo at 4 months with an arched back and quick turn of the leg.  It was safer to just put him on the floor, since that is where he would end up anyway.      I do caution those parents who put their child in the Bumbo and place it on tables or counter tops.  This is SO dangerous, and many children have been seriously hurt by falling from an incorrectly used Bumbo.",X_train

376,Stumbled across these wafer cookies at EPCOT in the Italy pavilion.  Enjoyed these with a glass of Pinot Grigio while watching the fireworks show!  They are delicious..and the dark chocolate is sweet..not bitter at all like some darks can be.  The wafer is light and crispy.  It is a good size bar...so it can be shared....but I always end up eating the whole thing myself!  We saved the wrapper and when we got home I searched for them and found them on Amazon.  We are still working our way through the box...but they are meant to savor...not eaten regularly like a store bought cookie.  Enjoy!,X_train

378,"The taste is pretty good. You need to use a fair amount of the powder (4-6 scoops for a coffee mug). The candy cane pieces sink to the bottom immediately, though. Even if I repeatedly stir it up, they stay at the bottom. They do flavor the drink with peppermint but I do not think by that much. Sometimes I eat the pieces after (hey, I like candy) but sometimes I just dump the candy out. I'd probably give this more like 3.5 stars if possible.<br /><br />May buy again, but will probably move on to other flavors.",X_train

In particular, the green tea and the English breakfast tea were (and are) quite good. I was not so much of fan of any of the others, actually. But, again, obviously that's the point of buying a sampler, and CS provides a very good range in this selection. If you're a tea drinker, I'd recommend this sampler.",X_train

383,"We read so many reviews before deciding on the Safety First High Def monitor; sadly it has been discontinued. I was in Target and saw the Graco Secure Coverage monitor, looked up the reviews and they were pretty good, so I got it and figured if it wasn't what I needed I would simply return it. We're very happy with the purchase. We live in a 3 br apt and the range is far enough to reach outside to our mailbox downstairs. We've had no issue with interference from our cell phones, wi-fi or neighboor's devices. At first we were concerned that the monitor wasn't loud enough to hear over the heater or air conditioner or dishwasher. It took a few nights to feel comfortable with the sound level. It has lights that indicate sound level as well as a vibration option in case you're a sound sleeper. We find that the noises that are \\""serious\\"" are heard/recognized with no trouble. I would recommend this product to anyone that has my similar needs. I feel the money was well spent.<br />*Update-<br />We've had this for almost 2 years and it has given us zero trouble! We would purchase this again. I have used the battery function on the kid's end of the monitor to move it temporarily into our room for the new baby while our older one played in his room where the monitor is usually stationed. It was simple to unplug it and move it without moving the bookcase to get the adapter from the outlet.",X_train

399,"I bought this for my son, who likes Irish breakfast tea primarily (I suspect) for its strength. We're both tea drinkers, though I have long preferred Lapsang Souchong. When this tea arrived, I drink almost as much as he did.<br /><br />This flavor is warm and possibly a little bit smoky. The generous teabags are great for our 20 oz cups, and if we don't pull the teabag after stepping it gets stronger but never bitter.<br /><br />It is very, very hard to go back to teas from the supermarket, no matter how elegant their brand names, after Barry's. (We tried a few expensive brand names when we temporarily ran out, and there was no comparison in the taste, not to mention the amount of tea in the bags.)<br /><br />Amazon's price for multiple-box deals is astonishingly economical,considering the quality of the tea.<br /><br />I recommend it and I'd give it 10 stars if I could.",X_train

Plus she's very tall for her age and these are a lot bigger than your average wrap which again made them my favorite.<br /><br />She didn't like to be swaddled much, always wanted to have her arms out so after about 3 months this acted as her sheet and to date this is still her sheet.<br /><br />I'd recommend these to everyone and anyone with a baby not just a swaddler but as the best coverup/sheet you can find on the market.",X_train

This tent wraps around the sides of the crib and attaches to the top of the crib rails.  There is plenty of room for my son to stand up inside.  They have made an improvement to the zipper so that toddlers can't unzip it from the inside.  There is a piece of material sewn inside covering the last 2 or so inches of the zipper so they can't work their little fingers in there and unzip the tent.  This is a must for any parent with a night wanderer.  Now I know that when I put my son to bed at night he is safe and comfortable and will still be there in the morning!",X_train

It has a safety clasp on it. It will screw on. You won't have to worry about your little one grabbing this off of you. Their little fingers can easily grasp onto this necklace, and it's safe for them to chew on. The silicone beads really feel great on their gums too. Now you can still wear jewelry while being a mom. The best part is that they can't drop or throw their teething ring, because it's around your neck. I hated being out and about, and they would throw their toy on the ground. I really wish I had one of these back then. It would have saved a lot of tears with my kids because I couldn't give them their dirty toy back. I feel really comfortable in recommending this product.

Around the 8th day my husband noticed the motor sounded strained and i wasn't getting as much as milk as i normally did ( 4 ounces each at the morning and evening sessions)   well on the 10th day, the suction power was almost non-existent. The most I pumped was one ounce. Then the suction button started to go over ( doesn't stop at the dial stop )I went out and got the manual pump instead and got 3 oz in 10 minutes  Luckily it looks like amazon is going to let me return it as it's still within the 30 day window. If they decide to just let me have a new one instead of refunding my money, i suppose i'll just have to sell it on craigslist.",X_train

The spindle rods that hold the gate in place for me are turned almost all the way out for a 40 inch opening and just seems like it may bend or warp out of place for a older toddler that may try to push or climb over it even with the wall cups in place. Also Regalo did not pay much attention to the bottom spindle rods will not work with anyone who has 3/4 round on their trim. You must use a riser or remove the 3/4 round in order to get the gate in place. I had to put a 1x2 wood board under mine to get the gate above the 3/4 round or you would have to remove it.",X_train

468,"This is probably the most stylish drying rack I've ever seen . . .for baby stuff or regular dishes.  I hemmed and hawed about which rack to get for bottles and breast pump supplies and finally decided this one was worth the investment.  It's not all that much more expensive than other racks, and since I plan to breast feed and pump, I need something that works for both bottles and breast pump supplies.  Bottle racks seem to be only for bottles, and specific ones at that, so I figured I'd try this.  I also bought the twig and flower accessories to hold little items.  So far I've only washed everything in the dishwasher and then put it on the rack to dry and it has worked well so far.  This is cute, seems to hold bottles and breast pump supplies just fine, and wasn't all that expensive (the accessories are $5 in the store and the grass is $15 in the store, so comparable to Amazon . . .but if you have a Buy Buy Baby store and coupons for it you'll pay less overall) in total.

469,I used this for a cobbler recipe that called for a cake mix. It worked out very well and a number of family members liked it better than the version made with a regular mix.

471,"Bought this pump mostly for it's battery-function and low cost for a &#34;hospital grade&#34; rating. Has proven itself to be excellent at both! I cannot recommend this pump enough! Features that I was surprised to find so helpful:<br />- night light and buttons with tactile feedback especially for those 3am pumps in the dark. I can just feel for the light and power button instead of groping around in the dark.<br />- time on the screen in case you forget to start your own timer<br />- how quiet it is-- especially compared to Medela FreeStyle battery pump. It's hard to be incognito when there's a very loud sound next to you.<br />- also &#34;feels&#34; less mechanical in case you mentally hate pumps<br /><br />MEDELA vs. SPECTRA<br />I rented the Medela Symphony ($85/month) and insurance bought the Medela FreeStyle which I used since the beginning. I will also be using the Symphony which is provided at work.<br /><br />The Symphony was great and had a strong suction. I was using 3 and 4-drop strength suction. However, I was able to get MORE milk using the Spectra L3 suction. The suction itself feels different -- more of a &#34;wave massage&#34; which has actually been much gentler on my nipples. I've also been able to shave off a few minutes which is always a bonus when pumping.<br /><br />The FreeStyle pumped absolutely NO milk even after 15 minutes. I tried it repeatedly and would sometimes ink out a few drops as the suction just wasn't strong enough. The Spectra runs on battery and is lightweight so you can tote it around. However, it's not small enough to tuck into your waistband (like the FreeStyle). But then again it works fast so there's really not need to be walking around with it anywhere.<br /><br />FEATURES<br />The Spectra S1 is phenomenal. Adjustable and programmable suction speed and strength which helped pumped even more milk than the Symphony. Super quiet and even comes with a handy night-light for those 3am pumps. Design is cute and friendly instead of a big ugly industrial pump. Lightweight and comes with a built-in handle.<br /><br />TIPS<br />- I also used the Medela parts that I already had at home. Just snipped one end off the piping parts to plug into the Spectra and they fit perfectly. Since this machine is only used by me, I wasn't worried about milk backing into the system (and therefore having to use the fancier parts). Saved tons of money and time from having to buy all new attachments.<br />- So great for travel since it can fit into a duffle bag pretty easilyof a big ugly industrial pump.

472,The problem with this gate is it just not sturdy.  The extensions are too big so it does not give you many options for different sizes.  I had to leave one out and now I have the bolts sticking out about 4-5 inches.  Since it works on tension this is not ideal.  We have a different brand for another room and that one is solid and sturdy and makes this gate feel cheap.,X_train

This was the best one, I was worried because some people in other reviews talked about false alarms, but I have not had an issue at all, if you read ALL the instructions it comes with it is VERY helpful! The only \\""false alarm\\"" I get is when I pick up my baby and forget to turn off the sensor (via the receiver) which has nothing to do with the product but my forgetfulness! (My husband was not happy when this happened at 3am, he cam rushing in the baby's room and just stared blankly at me, and then went back to bed.)<br /><br />I am OCD and a nurse who knows too much about what can go wrong, I am constantly worried about is my baby breathing? and is he ok? The sensor feature is what I wanted the most, the sound system is also a plus, it only turns on when the baby makes noise which is nice. It's pricy when compared to other monitors but I could not find one that compares to it =) I sleep great and have peace of mind.<br /><br />Side note: The sensor pad needs to be under the mattress on plywood (or something similar), and  you do have to set up the monitor before you plan to use it. Also to get the right angle of the camera which can be tricky. Some say this is a con of the product because of the wires and what not, but it does its job and a few extra minutes to move a mattress is not a problem in my book.",X_train

483,"My husband and I were very excited when we received this car seat as a gift for our first baby. In fact, we were so  excited ( because it just came out at the time and my husband did all the research on designs) that we returned our Maxi Cosi light weight car seat the same day. I wish we would have kept the Cosi...see below Now that we have been using this car seat for 17 months, I think I can give it an accurate review that will be helpful for other unknowing first time parents.  First this car seat is heavy. My daughter was 6lbs and it was difficult for me to take the car seat in/out recovering from birth in the first couple of weeks. As she gained weight it got progressively more difficult to take the car seat out and lift it enough to perfectly align with the UPPAbaby  Vista adapters. If you don't click them in just the right way you may walk around with the car seat half attached. Once my daughter was about  16lbs I was no longer able to lift her without help.... and if you are carrying anything else along with car seat ( i.e. groceries, diaper bag...) forget it.  Second, the buckles and soft pads on the shoulder straps are not comfortable and the material is really harsh on baby skin - especially in the summer as in our case. My daughter would frequently have strap marks on her neck and thighs from being in it.  The actually buckle is even harder to unlatch. If you have an arthritic grandparent, they wont be able to squeeze the red button hard enough to unlatch it. The buckle was hard for me to unlatch and I often found my self with a screaming baby wanting to cut the straps open to free her. While we are on the straps- my daughter is now 17 months and 31.6&#34; long... the straps are too tight and if you add a winter jacket its downright choking to her.  Yes, there are studies saying that you should take the child out of the snow suit before putting them in the car seat, but I would like to know how many parents voluntarily undress their squirming toddler ina freezing car every single time they go for a drive to the grocery store, after spending 45 minutes dressing them....Anyone? Didn't think so...  The weight max does say its 35lbs but doesn't really specify length of child... the way my daughter is positioned now, her feet are almost touching the backseat she's 31.6&#34;  tall and 21lbs,  so now we need to get a new car seat.  So in conclusion, its a great design with hook up/latch system... but the actual car seat is garbage. The material is rough and a pain to clean..... the straps are not comfortable, the buckle is impossible to unhook.... and potentially unsafe, if you need to take an infant out of a burning car... this might be the reason you are not able to in time.  Hoping that this review will not only help parents, but maybe the UPPAbaby team will have a read...",X_train

Two volume settings and an off setting (so it's not going off randomly when it hits something in the diaper bag).

However, the product description on Amazon says 'self standing fold..no bending'.  That is not necessarily true.  You do not need to bend to fold it....you flip the handle and gravity does the rest.  BUT, it does not stand when folded...it lays on the floor.  So you do have to bend to unfold it or move it.  There are some strollers that stand when folded so you never have to bend.  But those were heavier.  This stroller is relatively light - for a full size.  The car seat is small and lightweight as well.  We wanted a lightweight car seat for when we're taking the whole seat wtih the baby out of the car.  This seat only holds up to 22 lb babies.  So you will have to buy another seat sooner than the ones that hold 35 lbs.  But the car seat weight being lighter was worth it.  You'll have to buy another car seat anyway, so why not be better to your back and arms during those first few months!",X_train

532,"I spent hours researching double strollers and finally narrowed it down to two- the baby jogger city mini double and the Joovy. I ended up going with the Joovy bc of the price and the accessories. The baby jogger is twice the price and comes with NOTHING. No cup holders, no belly bar, no pockets, nothing. The Joovy has two parent cup holders and pockets and also pockets for the kids to put their junk in. The storage basket is HUGE and can fit pretty much anything!<br />  Most importantly, this stroller rides great. It's smooth, lightweight, and easy to push and turn.  My 2 year old and 4 month old both fit comfortably in their seats and really enjoy our walks.<br />  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because when you collapse it, it SLAMS to the ground scratching the belly bar like crazy. I suppose you could slow down and fold it with two hands to prevent that, but it would be tricky. Joovy needs to create a more controlled collapse so the belly bar doesn't get trashed.<br />  Overall, I loooove this stroller and I'm so happy we went with this instead of the pricy baby jogger.",X_train

554,"We have had great success with the Summer Swaddleme wraps but I wanted a bit more of a swaddle sack as those are pretty narrow in the legs.  I also loved the idea of the snaps, since the Velcro sometimes wakes my baby.<br /><br />Pros: love the material, as I knew I would.  (I have the regular Muslin blankets from A&A.) Of course it's super soft and cute and plenty of leg room, in width.. Although my 8 week old, stretched out, was about at the end of the bag for leg room.<br /><br />Cons: the button snaps.  I love the idea of no noisy Velcro but this took quite a while to get everything snapped.  There's snaps as the shoulders and then the swaddle snaps.  I found them a little difficult to push together.  Also, you have to wrap the swaddle under the baby to secure it.. I usually swaddle with my baby asleep, so it was more difficult to not wake her. As mentioned before, the size may run a little small.. My baby is 8 weeks, 10# and I was on the most loose setting of the wrap.<br /><br />Overall cute and probably good for smaller babies who are heavy sleepers and enjoy some leg freedom. We won't be using this as our main swaddle.",X_train

565,"I purchased this bag because I needed a diaper bag that will fit not only my newborn's essentials, but also snacks and toys for my older boys. I needed something that can take a beating as this will be the bag I take to baseball and soccer practices and games, as well as swimming lessons. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, because I know it's going to take a beating and I don't want to stress out about something happening to it. So far this is perfect. It is surprisingly durable and it's large enough to hold everything I need and it is SO cute. Yes it didn't come with a diaper pad, but for this price, that doesn't bother me at all. There's plenty of room to put a changing station in the large zipped pocket in the back as well as plenty of diapers, which leaves the entire inside for all the extras. The front zippers hold the keys and wallet without a problem. So far I'm very pleased. I'll let you know how it holds up after a few seasons and a summer of beach and swimming lessons.

602,"I initially thought the carrier would be useful only for errands and travel. Completely the opposite: in fact, I exclusively use it around the house at this point. While this is more portable than a stroller, the reality is that a stroller is easier. Put the baby in the car seat, clip it into the car, and then clip it into the stroller. Baby falls asleep in the car and stays buckled in and asleep the entire time, from car to stroller back to car. Pulling your baby out of the car seat to go into the Bjorn is basically inviting him/her to wake up and make a fuss. Additionally, although less bulky, you now have to carry your baby everywhere instead of simply pushing a stroller.<br /><br />So why is this a necessity? Want to do some chores aorund the house, like making a sandwich or pushing a Swiffer? Good luck doing that with your baby in one arm while you try to wrestle everything with the free arm. A swing or bouncy chair might buy you 20 minutes, but might also mean a screaming baby that wants to be held when all you want is 2 free hands do do something.<br /><br />Enter the Bjorn. It allows you to do most chores around the house, baby in tow, with your hands relatively unencumbered. Not only does it keep a content baby content (which a swing often fails to do) it will actually calm a screaming baby. As we hit the \\""witching hour\\"" of approaching bed time, and the associated crying meltdown, we throw our baby in the Bjorn. We put on music and gently dance along or walk around the house. The walking rhythm creates a gentle bobbing motion for the baby, which completely eliminates crying. It's like the comfort of a bouncer seat or swing, mixed with the feeling of being held.<br /><br />This is an absolute necessity to get anything done around the house and to calm a cranky baby.<br /><br />To get it on easily, skip the directions. Put on the shoulder straps, clip the bottom clips, and let the carrier dangle. Hold your baby to your chest. Newborns face you, once they have head control (generally a few weeks) they will probably prefer to face out so they can see what's going on. With one hand holding the baby high on your chest, use the other hand to grab the carrier and pull it between your baby's legs. Clip the sliding clip on the same side as your free hand. Now hold the baby in place with your free hand over the carrier, pull your other hand out from behind the carrier, and clip the remaining sliding clip. The baby is now held in place. Clip the two top clips and you're done. No more hassling with trying to get a leg through the hole or weasel the baby into the carrier. I normally do this over a sofa, so if I were to slip, it would be a shorter and padded drop.head control (generally a few weeks) they will probably prefer to face out so they can see what's going on.

Goes fantastic in salsas, caesars, bloody marys, scrambled eggs, perogi and sour cream dishes, chili, you name it.<br /><br />NEVER throw this on top of a stir-fry though: it's a fine powder, and aside of ruining the taste, the heat will aerosolize the pepper and your entire apartment will be like someone just discharged a canister of bear spray in it (something with which I have first hand knowledge, sadly).<br /><br />Excellent product!",X_train

Someone looking for a more intense chocolate sensation will want to order one of the Lindt bars with a higher cocoa content.

615,"It serves the purpose; the outlet functions well.  There are two main issues.  First, these outlets are slightly smaller than typical outlets with regards to the length and height.  In one room in my house where the walls are the original color, the contractor taped and painted around the &#34;standard&#34; outlets.  Upon installing these &#34;baby safe&#34; outlet covers, I now have an exposed unpainted border.  This isn't a major issue as it is easily remedied.  The reason for taking the time to review this item is the second issue.  Once again, not so much of an issue with the manufacturer but more so with the installation of the existing plugs.  About half of these outlets don't sit flush on my wall.  This is due to the fact that most outlets are perfectly square and level.  Standard outlets usually have a fair amount of wiggle and this allows a standards outlet cover to &#34;mate&#34; and sit flush.  The way that these outlets &#34;mate&#34; to the existing plugs doesn't always allow for nice, flush fit.  I believe this fit issue would occur at almost all homes. Both of these issues could be remedied, but the second one would take a significant amount of time and effort.  I probably wouldn't pay what these cost if I knew the fit was going to be so poor, or at a minimum I would only install these outlets at high use locations...I replaced every outlet in my entire house with them.",X_train

But i found it really inconvenient to use it with a newborn, when the baby  lying underneath and toddler sits on top, it's really hard to get the baby in and out with the second sit on top. When the baby can sit and you put 2nd sit on the back then it's really convenient, compact and stylish double stroller. I am a petit women so for me using a bulky side by side stroller just  wasn't an option. The other thing to keep in mind- kids can't really sleep in this stroller because they are in up right position all the time , unless you using it as a single.

I got gorilla glue and glued all of the pieces together in the joints. 2 days later... in pieces. Today, I purchased epoxy to see if that would help hold it together and zip tied it to her bed since the screws come out of the legs.

644,"I purchased this bassinet after many nights wondering if our 8 month old daughter would be able to sleep in a pack and play on our holiday trip where we stayed at a hotel. At her stage (crawling) she would have to basically sleep close to the floor as the pack and play has one other option which she can easily crawl out of and seriously injure herself. I didn't like the idea of my daughter sleeping so close to the floor (possible SIDS concerns and she would not sleep well) and the only other traveling option was to get a co-sleeper in bed. We checked all the possible options and came upon the Brica Fold N' Go - mesh linings, easy portability (slid into the crevice in the car under her car seat) and fits just right (and comfortably) on a king bed in the hotel between my husband and me. My daughter was 26.5 inches at her 6 month check up so I imagine she's somewhere now in the 28\\"" range. The bassinet is 30\\"" long. So with great trepidation as this was the only best option for my big baby, I purchased this and was quite pleased! She's a bit of a tight squeeze, but she slept so well in it and would wiggle herself around until she found the right spot for her to settle. In the bed, we can easily turn to see her and hear her breathe, so it was not as concerning as if she was in the pack and play near the floor all alone.

671,"Two complaints about this unit are:<br /><br />1) The quality of the battery is not very good.  By that, I mean that my baby is 6 1/2 months old now and the battery may last two hours in noise activated mode if we're lucky.  Early on, it would last through all of her naps during the day, so its charged capacity is degrading rapidly meaning it's a low quality battery, not like what they put in their cell phones where my phone lasts nearly as long as it did brand new two years later.<br /><br />Unfortunately it is also not user replaceable, so once it won't hold a charge at all, you're going to be carrying the power adapter around with it.<br /><br />2) The image quality is not that great.  If you're wondering if your kid is breathing, you have to stare at the thing pretty closely to try and discern movement amongst all the pixelated edges.  Perhaps a higher contrast in color between kid clothing and bedding would help.<br /><br />Anyway, those are the negatives.

Warms a bottle in about 10 minutes just as advertised. You do have to do some anticipating of when your baby will be ready for a bottle but so far I haven't found this to be a major problem. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because one of the two units I recieved has a tendency to activate even when I don't want it to.

681,"This is our fourth baby out of seven children, so we have used several different infant car seats over the years.  When I first opened the box, I noticed how cheap the fabric of this seat is.  It is very similar to the feel of chintzy outdoor furniture and is rather stiff.  There is almost NO padding in this car seat compared to similar infant car seats.  We will have to purchase polyester batting to go under the cover in the back or our baby will continue to be VERY uncomfortable in this seat with her little backbone up against the ultra-hard styrofoam.  I don't understand how one reviewer said that this was a very cushy car seat??  Also, for a 6-pound baby, the straps cut into the sides of her neck, so we'll be needing some strap covers, which we have never had to purchase for any of our other children.<br />The straps were super-easy to adjust from one set of holes to the next, and also to adjust the length of, but the interval between the holes is just a little bit too long.  The lowest setting is too low, even for a small newborn, and the next setting is simply too high, even for an average newborn.  I can't understand why they have the lowest setting where it is, because it's too low even for our daughter's 15-inch doll!  Our last infant seat had 4 settings, which was perfect.  This seat leaves a lot to be desired...<br /><br />The canopy is cute and does the job it is expected to do, the seat is very easy to latch and unlatch out of the base to get it in/out of our 12-passenger van.  The handle is basic and easy to carry.  The color is adorable and very unique compared to most infant car seats out there, but I really dislike the feel of the cover because of the cheap fabric used.  Overall, I would not recommend this car seat to a friend, and I'm on the fence as to whether I should return it or not.<br /><br />UPDATE: Our littlest is now 8 months old and 17 pounds and she is still using this car seat.  The handle is comfortable to carry, it's not heavy at all,and it is easy to get in and out of the base.  The straps are still super-easy to adjust and taking the cover off to wash it is a breeze, unlike other car seats we have had.  The cover and canopy still look new after all these months of use.  I added extra padding to the back but she seems uncomfortable in it now, so we are looking for a new car seat.  We are still using strap covers because the straps are just too close to her little neck and would rub her skin if we didn't have the strap covers on.  Her shoulders are at the top of the highest strap slot, so I wouldn't see this fitting her until she was 22 pounds.  She loves to reach above her head and pull the canopy off to play with it...  I think she enjoys the rustling sound it makes.  This hasn't posed any hazards, as there is always someone sitting next to her, but if a mother is driving alone with her infant, I could see how this could be a scary situation.

685,I bought these because I was worried about the reports of bumpers being a suffocation hazard.  I like these but don't love them.  I really don't think there is a better solution though.  My daughter is 9 months old and now that she's mobile when she's throwing a tantrum in her crib she takes her anger out on these poor things.  She's able to slide them down to look over them (apparently she thinks we're hiding on the floor or something).  They are pretty durable after all she's put them through.  One complaint I have is that I wish the ties were on the top AND the bottom.  Mine only have the ties on the top which doesn't hold them in place all that well.  They were easy to put on and the velcro is pretty strong.  She is still able to put her arms and legs through the slats above the bumper but she doesn't do it often.  She hasn't figured out how to get below the bumper yet.  Overall I would recommend these bumpers and I would buy them again.,X_train

These aren't cheap so when you can get them on sale they are definitely a catch. Of the flavors I've had, I'd have to say that Blueberry Muffin, Apple Pie and Key Lime Pie (if you like this flavor, they've pretty much nailed the taste) are the best of the bunch. I was not impressed with most of the chocolate flavors, but then again I am not terribly partial to chocolate.",X_train

After steeping for probably 10 minutes (I forgot about it) I poured myself of cup. The peppermint taste isn't too strong, but I like the taste. There's way too many health benefits to name but the one that stuck out to me was that it has 3x more (found that on Google although the description says 9x) iron than spinach! This is great news for me since I'm anemic and hate taking iron pills. Not saying that I will stop altogether but it's good to know I can drink tea for iron and not have to eat a bunch of spinach.

After an 8hr day of use and storing wet parts, removing the parts for washing, they come out dry. Since it's reuseable, I'm no longer wasting money constantly using a new ziplock bag every day. Would def recommend and would buy more. This size is perfect for your pump parts, if you use the bag adapters, not bottles. I'd go one size up if you pump into bottles.

With two in boosters and one in a car seat, I've placed towels under their seats to try to minimize the damage. While it is better than nothing, it certainly doesn't compare to the Cruisy Kids Car Seat Protector I got to go under Jax's car seat.<br /><br />With three kids, you would think I would have known these existed by now! I have actually seen the mat that's just a simple mat that goes under the seat but nothing as extensive as this.<br /><br />This covers the back of the seat as well as the bottom and even has a flap that goes under the front and one that extends between the back of the seat so all those nasty crumbs won't get wedged in there.<br /><br />The other thing I really like about it that is a huge upgrade from a towel is the no slip surface on the bottom. One you put this on your seat, it clings to it and it isn't going anywhere!<br /><br />Jax just turned one yesterday. While legally I can now turn his car seat around, I'd like to leave him rear facing as long as he'll fit for safety reasons. I like that this can adjust from being a protector for rear facing to forward facing.<br /><br />The other feature that I love is the pockets on the front. where you can stick things in like bottles, spare diapers, toys or anything you want quick access to. When I'm driving and the baby's fussing, I can now just reach behind me to grab his bottle out of the pocket without having to dig for it or even turn around and take my eyes off the road.<br /><br />The Cruisy Kids Car Seat Protector ensures that my van's seats will stay nice as long as possible. It keeps food off the seats, pressure points from puncturing my seat and gives me added convenience with it's pockets. Now I just need to get a couple more for the other two boosters!",X_train

Even if you don't overuse detergent, over time your clothes get a build up on them, even with normal detergent use.

Her leg fits great and he can't seem to pull her out of the mesh yet.  I have not had good luck putting teething biscuits in the mesh.  It creates a giant mess almost immediately.

776,"We have a new puppy and want to keep her confined to the kitchen. There is a 5' wide opening between the kitchen and the living room. I bought this gate because I didn't want to have to attach hardware permanently to my walls and I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a wood gate that would span 60 inches.    It's a little tricky to put up at first but once I got it up I was impressed with how securely it stayed in place. Once I got the hang of putting it up, I can do it pretty quickly. Once I figured out the 'secret' of folding it up (get the vertical bars unhinged before undoing the horizontal bars), taking it down was a snap. I also love that it folds so it can be easily stored out of sight when not in use.    For the price, I couldn't ask for a better product. I'm a bit concerned about my puppy tearing the mesh but so far that hasn't been a problem. But it's something to think about if you want it for a pet.",X_train

788,"For an instant disc/pod espresso, the Gevalia espresso for Tassimo is very good.  It is the best of the espressos offered for the Tassimo line.    I recently discovered a trick for making it even more delicious. For an extra rich and full-bodied espresso, combine 2 t-discs into one cup, with each one's brew shortened halfway to increase the strength.  On the original Tassimo machine, this is accomplished by pressing the button and releasing it after the drip has been going for just a few seconds.  For many people, a regular brew of a single t-disc might be fine, but it was tasting a bit weak for me (maybe I've been spoiled by too many Peets espressos, which really pack a punch).    Yes, it does use up the t-discs more quickly, but a 2-disc cup of espresso costs only about $1.10 - which is still far cheaper than a double espresso at Starbucks ($1.95) or Peets ($2.20).",X_train

826,"I was very skeptical when first trying the Iced VIA, particularly since, as another reviewer noted, the addition of sugar (NOT Splenda, alas) to the mix is clearly stated on the package.  Howver, this product turns out to be a huge win for me.  First of all, unlike the regular or decaf VIA which I also love (see my review of [[ASIN:B00451WLYI Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee, Decaf Italian Roast, 3-Count Packets (Pack of 6)]]), a single serving packet makes 16 oz., not 8 oz -- in other words, you get twice as much.  Second, if you just add a little milk or half and half (I use 4 Mini-Moos for one 16 oz. serving) plus a squirt of your favorite chocolate syrup, it's better than a Mocha Frappucino, and at a fraction of the price for a larger serving than even the large size bottles.  Even though it's now no longer summer, this is still my favorite way to start the day.  I'm saving a lot of money by no longer buying Frappucinos, not to mention the effort of lugging a case home from Sam's Club every week.  And the sugar content is LOWER than that of a Frappucino -- even if you add your own chocolate -- which pleases me.  In fact, a Mocha Frappucino out of the glass bottle now tastes too sweet to me.<br /><br />Amazon is apparently getting ready to offer a 50-pack case of Iced VIA, which is fabulous news -- I can't wait!  :)<br /><br />P.S.  To make it easier to prepare, I keep several recycled 16-oz. plastic water bottles in the fridge.  Each time I want a new 16 oz. cup of Iced VIA, I use one bottle, then refill it with tap water and return it to the fridge.  No need to use a measuring cup or fuss with ice -- the chilled water is always waiting for me and makes a perfect iced coffee each time!<br /><br />P.P.S.  I have a new \\""best way\\"" to make this:  take a \\""Working\\"" glass  [[ASIN:B003LL83X6 Luminarc 3053195 Working Glass jar 21oz, 12 PACK.]], pop the contents of one packet of iced Via into it, fill with skim milk up to the top of the highest indentations in the glass (exactly 16 oz!), and stir.  Done!  I used to then plop some chocolate syrup into it but now find I no longer need even that.  Behold, in seconds a frappuchino that is bigger, non-fat (as opposed to \\""low fat\\""), and lower in sugar than the commercial bottles.  And if you need to take it away, put the matching lid on the glass (search \\""working glass\\"" -- all lids fit both sizes of working glasses).  My new, 8-second method of preparing a marvelous frappuchino to start the day!!! (almost as fast as just grabbing a bottle out of the refrigerator, and both cheaper and lower in calories, too!).",X_train

I did add Flavacol and Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping as well to get even closer to that movie theater taste.<br /><br />I cook mine in a Whirley Pop and it works well. I think to get true movie theater flavor you have to cook it in a true popcorn popper with the kettle that dumps the popcorn right after popping it. I think that on the stove you lose some flavor as the popcorn stays in the kettle and is subject to additional heat and moisture after it pops.<br /><br />All in all the packaging is nice and easy to use.

864,I use these everyday with no issues.  I've made both coffee and tea with these.  The build quality seems nice.  My eco-brew mesh came apart after a while so I decided to try these. We'll see if these stand the test of time.  The price can't be beat for the two pack.,X_train
865,"I'll slit this into Pros and Cons.<br /><br />Pros: The flavor is great. There's even two flavors you can't get even with the assorted Swedish Fish. Blue Raspberry, and Grape. They taste great, and I wish I could get them included with the Assorted fish. It's interesting to see the different shapes they gave the fish too, adds some variety to the same old shape. The whole bag lasted me about 2 weeks. (Assorted lasted 1 week, I'll explain in the Cons)<br /><br />Cons: The consistency is way off. They are very chewy. Not like the chewy you usually get from Swedish fish, but more like chewing very sticky caramel. They stick to your teeth, and its really annoying, even if they do taste good. I've done a side by side comparison with the Assorted Fish, and the Aqua Life seem to be thinner, and the consistency is harder. The Assorted, and regular Red fish, while still a bit chewy and sticky, are much softer, and barely stick to your teeth. And because they are easier to bite, they seem to taste almost better. Also the non-Aqua Life dissolve faster just from being in your mouth, which I think is why they taste better, since the flavor spreads throughout your saliva. Personally, I don't think I'll be getting them again, the Assorted and regular are just much more enjoyable to eat.(this is why the Assorted 5lb bag lasted 1 week.) It's a shame really, I was hoping these would be really good.",X_train
866,My dad loves these meat and cheese bundles. I purchased him one for Christmas and he loved it. He especially liked the sausage. I snuck in a few bites to see how the product rated and I found the cheese to be extremely plastic-y in texture. The crackers and mustard were not really huge standouts either. What was nice was the cutting board and cheese knife that came packaged. It was a nice touch and certainly classed this gift up.  My dad had no complaints about the gift so I would recommend it!,X_train

879,"My baby girl started teething around four months old and drooled like crazy. She would develop little rashes on her chest because the drool would soak through her bibs and down through her clothing to her skin. I searched high and low at our local stores for bibs but could only find the regular bibs (not water proof) or the ones I found were huge - much more for like a toddlers size. Anyhow, when I found these I thought I'd give them a try. Though they are somewhat plain they are great. They have a plastic backing so that drool, milk, or food can not penetrate and get onto clothing or soak through to skin. Since we started using these my daughters skin stays dry and we are not constantly changing her clothes throughout the day. She is now 7 months old and we couldn't be more pleased with them. One suggestion - for longer life, do not tumble dry. Hand wash after each use and lay flat to air dry. The dryer may burn/melt the backing or actually shrink the bib. I would recommend these to all.",X_train

885,I bought this when we moved to our new apartment because I didn't want to trip over a huge high chair.  My daughter loves this seat and can't wait to sit in it for her meals.  It comes with 2 trays so when one snap out tray is being washed you can use the main tray for feeding.  It also comes with a cover so that the trays don't get dusty or gross when not in use.  The seat also has 3 height settings so that you can adjust it to get baby closer to the table so s/he can eat off the table.  The seat back also folds for compact storage.  It is also very lightweight and you can move it while holding baby too.  This chair is VERY easy to attach to the chair and when both straps are tightened the seat stays very snug.  There is no need for non slip rubber feet with how tight the straps stay.  This chair is a best bet for small spaces or when baby gets too big for a high chair.,X_train

I have babies that love to be swaddled and require it to sleep well. Just using a blanket is fine when they are newborns, but as they get older and stronger, they break out of the swaddle a lot more easily. This means I have to get up in the middle of the night and rewrap, which ends up really waking them up. Any new mom knows that sleep is a precious commodity! The Velcro is nice and strong, just make sure you stick it down when washing them to avoid gunking it up!

The gate is simple to put up but you may want to check the measurements as the other gate we have had two add-on attachments while this had one.

947,"My infant got a cold and I wanted to find something to help relieve his congestion. All the mucus buildup that wasn't easily making its way out was interfering with nursing and his sleep at night. A friend of mine highly recommended the NoseFrida aspirator. After reading the many great reviews and comparing that aspirator and Baby Comfy Nose, I decided to go with the latter, solely because of the fact that I don't have to commit to buying filters, which seems a lot more cost effective. I must report that the Baby Comfy Nose did not help relieve my baby's congestion. Yes, it sucked some boogies out of his nose, but those were close enough to the surface to easily come out on their own after I sprayed his nose with saline spray. All the mucus that was inside remained there and continued to bother my little guy. I don't know if perhaps I'm not sucking the air hard enough but I'm doing it to a point where my head starts to hurt, so this shouldn't be it. Also, when I called their customer service number about a question I had, the representative was extremely rude and condescending (way to treat your customers!). I am going to try the NoseFrida, after all that aspirator has over a thousand reviews, whereas this one only a couple hundreds (many of which might be questionable per one reviewer's feedback that the company was offering free aspirators in an exchange for five star reviews on Amazon).

It works really well for my little girl when she is asleep, but if she isn't asleep it drives her crazy because she can't get to her hands, and her pacifier doesn't stay in good with it on.

957,"Because of the high price of the Baby Bjorn carriers, and the Miracle ($120 at Amazon, $180 elsewhere) in particular, we vigorously looked for alternatives.  We tried on about 9 other models and purchased a Chicco Ultrasoft Magic - Rattania ($69).  The Chicco was okay but in the end we returned it and went with the Bjorn Miracle, which simply is awesome and well worth the price (difference).<br /><br />STYLES<br />Many models only strap over the shoulder and under the arm pit, connecting again in the lower front.  We found these to be very uncomfortable for our backs and not worth considering.<br /><br />Then there are \\""cross-over\\"" designs forming an \\""X\\"" in the back, like the Original Baby Bjorn and others.  These are better, but still not comfortably supportive for any length of time.  If you're going to buy a carrier you want one you can wear for extended periods when necessary (think shopping or watching a parade).<br /><br />The most comfortable and supportive models are those that have both a \\""belt\\"" and a connection *in the back* between the belt and the shoulder straps.  This connection distributes the weight from the shoulder harness to the waist belt for much better support and less back strain.  Both Chicco Ultrasoft Magic - Rattania and Baby Bjorn Miracle have this design.<br /><br />COMPARISON<br />- The belt for the Chicco Magic straps around stomach level rather than waist.  This puts more strain and makes it less comfortable for longer periods of time (more than 15 minutes or so).  The Bjorn Miracle straps around the waist - and it very adjustable to fit the waist of different size people.  The comfort and support difference is huge.  The baby feels a natural part of my body weight when in the Bjorn Miracle.<br />- The straps on the Chicco Magic are also ridged and difficult to adjust.  The Bjorn Miracle straps slide easily when needed but hold firm otherwise.  Bjorn Miracle has 4 straps, all easily adjusted, the baby \\""compartment\\"" strap to maximize baby's comfort, and 3 levels of \\""snaps\\"" at carrier waist, at baby's midsection, and at baby's shoulders.  They are easy to put on and off without help and quick to use.<br />- The Bjorn Miracle shape supports inward-facing baby's head well but is cut in a way to allow the baby to look side-to-side and not feel smothered.  Many other models didn't allow for this.<br />- Our baby was VERY comfortable from the first time in the Bjorn Miracle.  Less so in the Chicco (but okay), and not at all in many of the models we tried in the store.<br /><br />We wanted to avoid the price of the Miracle, but in the end we chose it as the best for a comfortable carrier.  There's no comparison between the quality of the Miracle and all of the other models we examined.  A more expensive model we'll actually use is a better bargain than a less expensive one we give up on due to discomfort.",X_train

And the blood orange Dry Soda doesn't taste like blood orange San Pellegrino.  They aren't meant to.  If you want something sweet but not as cloying as normal sugared drinks, then these are great.

966,"Recently (I think it was their cookie show) ATK voted Lurpak as the #1 butter in their tasting. And unlike Rach Ray who doesn't think twice about recommending the most ludicrous ingredients that cost the most, I have tremendous respect for Chris Kimball because he actually knows what he's talking about.<br /><br />The taste of Lurpak is very similar to Land O' Lakes, which IMO is truly the standard of butter. I have only tried it a few times since I do not have any recipes that call for butter, but I wanted to try Lurpak since it was so highly recommended. On a piece of toast it is fine and it melts very well.<br /><br />It comes in a little block and it is extremely firm (the sign of all fine butter).<br /><br />I am not certain if I will purchase this again since I was not overly impressed with Lurpak and because Land O' Lakes comes packaged much nicer and is a lot less. Nevertheless, Lurpak is still a good butter to try and to use if you have any recipes that call for a high-fat content butter.<br /><br />Anyway I found this at Shop Rite (don't you dare buy this online unless you enjoy paying more than twice the price - it is stold at all grocery stores) for two ninety-nine for 8 ounces (which is the size of 2 Land O' Lakes sticks).<br /><br />Remember, you don't have to spend a lot to be a great cook.",X_train

I can't comment on the mess-free prints because I will not be having my baby for a few more months and therefore cannot use it yet, but I love that it comes with instructions to use it, and I love the photo corners that this book comes with. That is so much better than trying to scotch tape pictures like I have done in the past with baby books. My only complaint is that on one of the pages that is supposed to be a \\""photo memories\\"" page (and therefore is supposed to be blank) has an upside-down copy of a previous page printed on it.

1018,"I had a horrible, terrible taste in my mouth 2 days after eating this. I thought it was because of some junk food I got from McD's or Dunkin, but no ... it was this pesto; because I ate some more of it a day and half ago, and I'm experiencing the same disgusting, gross metallic puke taste. It's too bad, because I loved the way it tasted so much that I bought more. I had some chicken, bowties, Pesto alla Genovese, and some TJ parmesean the 1st time; some spaghetti, walnuts Pesto alla Genovese, and parmesean the 2nd time. I've eaten the parmesan many times on many different things. So, the only new product, both times, is this pesto. Looking at the ingredients and Googling, I believe it gave me something called &#34;Pine Mouth&#34; or &#34;Pine Nut Syndrome.&#34; The complaints associated with this condition point to &#34;cheap&#34; pine nuts. I have no idea what that means or if that's the case here. The bottle says this is a &#34;Product of Italy.&#34; I never had a problem with pine nuts before, but the description of a overwhelming horrible taste and nausea are exactly the same as what I've experienced twice after eating different bottles of this product. I've never heard of &#34;Pine Mouth&#34; before, and I'm not saying it will affect anyone else like this. But it was a terrible experience for me. It tasted fine going in, but a day and a half later -- yuck. UPDATE: I accidentally had some pesto on a turkey sandwich, from an Italian restaurant, after I posted this review. I had the same delayed belly pains. So, I shouldn't target this product alone -- maybe other people will have no problem with it. Something has happened to the pine nut industry -- allegedly a Chinese species being mixed in with other types, causing &#34;pine nut syndrome.&#34; I go to the store and see pasta with pesto, and I think, &#34;That'll taste great.&#34; But then I remember -- no, never again pine nuts and pesto.

1023,"I currently owned the Sleepy Wrap carrier before purchasing this product. My newborn baby absolutely loved the Sleepy Wrap, but it was kind of a pain getting her in and out of it as well as breastfeeding (I'm large breasted). I decided to give this carrier a try as it looked like it was easy to get her in and out and would make for more discreet breastfeeding (plus I am a fan of Dr. Sears). Anyway, it took forever to get this product in the mail (2 weeks), however, delivery aside, the product is subpar, especially for the price. My baby can only stand being in this carrier if I am constantly walking around. If I am at a sit still she hates it, whereas with the Sleepy Wrap, she falls asleep immediately sitting, standing, walking, whatever.     Anyway, I guess there is no such thing as a perfect carrier, and my daughter prefers the Sleepy Wrap carrier over this one. She is only 7 weeks old, so time will tell. I will hold onto this carrier and try again in the future, but for now, to me, it's definitely not worth the money.",X_train

The boxes/candy are about a third the size they used to be. The texture and flavor of these is also very different.

1048,"After years of eating oatmeal for breakfast, I got burnt out.  Since I know there are lots of warm grain cereals out there in this big ol' world and I do love me a hot bowl of grains in the morning, I decided to shop around for something different.  That's when I stumbled upon this gluten-free hot cereal.  I'm not celiac, nor do I have any kind of gluten-intolerance but I liked the ingredient list of this cereal (brown rice, corn, buckwheat, white sorghum).  The taste reminds me of [[ASIN:B004VLSWFY Bob's Red Mill Organic Kamut Grain, 24-Ounce (Pack of 4)]] which is to say it reminds me of grits--both in texture and taste.  I like that it's not sweet on it's own and could be served savory or sweet.  I personally enjoy it with chia seeds, a spoonful of nut butter and a sliced up banana (very  much like I eat my oatmeal).  All in all, great product.  There again, Bob's Red Mill never seems to fail me!<br /><br />One more note: I cook mine per the package instructions (10 minutes on low for 1/4 cup), but I also like to let it sit for 2-3 minutes after the 10 minutes are up.  The texture becomes thicker and it's easier to scrape out of the pan.  Obviously if thicker cereals don't appeal to you, I'd use a bit more water (1 full cup + a bit more) whilst cooking.",X_train

1064,"My husband and I purchased three of these units to use as an added level of security throughout our home. The first downside we noticed (compared to the Sony brand we had used previously) was that you couldn't pair multiple &#34;baby&#34; units to a single &#34;parent&#34; unit. However, we set them up anyway with two of the &#34;baby&#34; units downstairs near our entry doors and two of the &#34;parent&#34; units in our master bedroom. We also had the third set up in our son's room to use as a true baby monitor.<br /><br />These units didn't have the constant (and surprising) loud static noise we had experienced with our Sony monitors. However, they would often &#34;unlink&#34; and lose connection at random times throughout the day and night. This essentially made them useless to us as they weren't helpful if they weren't linked! We ended up returning the two &#34;security&#34; units and keeping only the one in our son's room. The one being used as a baby monitor is great and doesn't seem to ever unlink or lose its connection now that it is the ONLY one in the house.

1079,"I buy the Itzbeen for every friend of mine that has a baby.  It's the best.  In the middle of the night when you haven't slept in weeks, no more do you have to ponder whether you fed the baby, thought about feeding the baby or just dreamed about feeding the baby.  Also, you hit the button so you don't have to worry about what time it was, FINALLY!  There's a nightlight so you can check on the little bugger, too.  A nursing switch will remind you which breast you nursed last, as well.  There is also a lock on it so you can't accidentally hit a button and throw your whole game off.<br /><br />The best part about the Itzbeen for me is:<br /><br />1. I learned my baby's schedule without having to make one up and try to have him accommodate my assumptions about him.  It got down to a science.  For instance, At one point, I knew that my baby could stay awake between 1 hr and 14 minutes and 1 hour and 21 minutes and after that, it would be much more difficult for him to fall asleep.<br /><br />2.  I learned my baby's cries very quickly.  Because of the ItzBeen, I knew what was probably bothering him since I could assess what had or hadn't been addressed with some serious accuracy.<br /><br />3.  When my parents would babysit, I wouldn't have to give a long explanation about what's been happening.  Just handed over the ItzBeen.<br /><br />The ItzBeen is way better than the iphone app.  It's simpler and only addresses how long ItzBeen since the last act, so you don't have an account of every single thing you've done with your baby since he's been born.  Believe me, you'll never need that much information!  You just need an ItzBeen.",X_train

1105,"This butter like topping is very good.  I did read some reviews before purchasing which did sway in my decision to buy this topping for my home popcorn.  Most of the reviews were positive, some negative but the positive outweighed the negative, therefore, I decided to buy some.  Some reviewers said it tastes just like at the movies and some said it does not, but more said it did than not.  In my opinion this topping is not an exact match in taste as the butter topping they use in the theaters, or at least in my area.  I live in the suburbs of Los Angeles and go to the movies in various locations in Southern California.  It is possible that the other reviewers who say this taste just like at the theater visit theaters that do use this or one just like it.  I go to the movies at either Edwards Cinema (Regal) or AMC theaters.  This topping is good but not an exact match.  Someone mentioned Mor Gold is creamier and just like the theater.  I found that Wabash Butter Flavored Topping actually is creamy too, at least compared to that at the theaters that I go to the movies.  The butter topping at the theaters that I visit is very thin and very liquidy actually, which makes this stuff seem to be creamy and thick.  I think people are accustomed to \\""movie butter\\"" topping and anything less or different is not acceptable.  For awhile I was melting real butter and putting in on the popcorn but honestly, even if real butter is higher quality and the real thing, I can't get used to butter on my popcorn and went on the quest of this synthetic like topping that is used at movie theaters.  Although this is not an exact match am I happy with this product?  Yes I am, is the answer.  This topping actually does taste like butter but not exactly. If it was exactly like butter taste I'd not use it any longer but it is not just like butter but has some taste properties.   It falls somewhere between real butter taste and that synthetic stuff from the movie theater that I like so much.  HeckI might use this on corn on the cob and see how it is.  I have no complaints about this stuff at all and a little goes a long way.  I just purchased this recently, came the other day and I tried it out on some popcorn.  Tasted good.  So this will last me a long time. When it's all said and done I might try some of that O'Dell brand, I heard good things about it.  So bottom line is I rather get an exact taste copy as the kind I am used to at the theater but I can say this is very good stuff.  Would I buy it again? Yes I would but I'd compare O'Dell brand first and after comparing the two I'd go for the one I like best.  I think that Amazon actually carries O'Dell also so you might want to look into it.",X_train

I wish we had known about this bread growing up, thier lives could have been spared. I sometimes eat up to five pieces a day with no weight gain. I eat the slices raw and untoasted, but made into toast or french toast it is delicious too.<br /><br />The price has gone up, but I got a bunch of loafs on sale for $3.99 each at \\""Down to Earth\\"", in Kapolei Hawaii.<br />If you write the company they will send you coupons.<br /><br />If you want to be regular, energetic, and disease free eat this bread and none other.<br />Deb",X_train

The parent unit just beeps and says &#34;not linked.&#34; I tried resetting both units and followed all instructions in the manual. It's dead.

1117,"I love macadamia nuts and I love chocolate. But this particular formulation is less than the sum of its parts. As other reviewers have noted, the nuts are generally quite small, and they are surrounded by a much-too-thick coating of not-so-great chocolate. Ultimately there is no discernible macadamia taste at all.<br /><br />As noted in the questions, the nuts are not salted. The chocolate has a waxy texture and is way too sweet.<br /><br />These come at a premium price. I would be willing to pay it if they would reformulate them with sea salt and a thin coating of a better quality chocolate with a good snap. And slightly bigger macadamias!<br /><br />But as they are, I regret the purchase.",X_train

I gave it 4 stars  because when we put it together (which took no more than 10 minutes), the plastic windshield broke also the side mirrors sit straight forward and don't turn. Since that's my son's main entertainment on the car, its a shame they don't move or aren't turned inward bit since he spends more than half his time in it leaned over as much as possible with both hands on the mirror and starts getting irritated with it.

I particularly love the front pockets and the fact that the chest binder strap can be \\""slid\\"" up and down for a custom fit.      Only con for me is that it isn't as easy to breastfeed in as my AngelPack carrier.  The reason for this is because the straps are contoured so \\""sliding\\"" the pack down a bit to get my baby to the right height for nursing means I have the straps sitting funny on my shoulders.  However, it is much easier to put on than my AngelPack and more comfortable to me.",X_train

We tried several more times and same thing. He is an average size toddler so I am not sure what size of kid this would be comfortable for.

1141,"With five years between our previous child and our latest baby, we decided to get a new and improved car seat.  After reviewing many different brands, we decided on the Keyfit 30.  We love it!  Its quality is much better than our older model and you really have a confident feeling that your baby will be safe within it.  When we took our little one home from the hospital, the RNs there stated that our seat was great, especially since it came with a small-infant insert.  Our little girl was premature, so she only weighed 5 lbs 14 oz by the time we were allowed to leave the hospital.  Since then, she has grown quite large and still seems very happy in the seat.<br /><br />The base is also great.  It's so easy to install with its single pull cord and adjustable foot.  We have a 2012 Honda Odyssey Elite and it fits perfectly in the middle row in the middle seat which is designed for an infant seat.  Our older 5 year old has her large Britax Boulevard seat next to it and the two fit just fine without needing to slide the side seat over closer to the sliding door (which the Odyssey supports).  We can still let the one remaining seat stay free for a rider or to get access to the third row.<br /><br />It's big, which makes it hard to shop with, but then safety comes first.  Also, you really have to lift on it after putting it in the base to make sure it's secure as it doesn't click each time without pushing it down and wiggling it a bit.  Last, I wish there was a way to adjust the carrier arm by only pressing the release button on one side.  Moving the arm in the middle row is kind of tough given you have to put your hands on both sides and press the buttons before the arm will move.<br /><br />P.S.  Our little one had an accident in the seat and with some patience, we were able to take the entire liner out and all the straps.  This made it easy to clean in the washer (front load on gentle).  Of course I took off the metal buckle parts, the chest clip and didn't put the buckle button strap in the washer.",X_train

None of the 10 other brands on the shelf at my local spice store listed anything but pure tamarind, certainly no sweetener, and no CORN SYRUP.<br /><br />There is clearly something wrong with this brand.

Overall, this is a pretty good purchase and is still stylish enough to be used after diapers and I don't feel like I'm carrying yet another baby accessory when I'm out and about.",X_train

1200,"This was a cake mix that we always had around the house when I was growing up.  I liked eating it for breakfast, dessert, snack, whatever.  My family was very familiar with it and we loved it.  Over the years, it became harder to find in stores.  I think the last time we had it was about 7 years ago.  I felt like having coffee cake recently, so we tried another brand.  It was pretty awful.  I came on to Amazon, found this old favorite, and ordered.<br /><br />It arrived quickly and I made a box that night for my family.  It brought back a flood of memories for me as I mixed it up in the familiar plastic bag, poured it into the cardboard tray and added the crumb topping.  I liked to mix the batter in that bag when I was a child.  Now, it seemed a little difficult to get all the lumps out.  I had to use a fork to break some up before adding the topping.  Other than that, the cake is as easy to make as before.  It turned out well.  The cake had the same flavor and texture as years ago.<br /><br />We all agreed that it still tastes the same as we remembered, however, it is a little saltier than it used to be.  But, it is hands-down still the best coffee cake mix.",X_train

1222,"I got this carseat as a shower gift for my daughter. I absolutely love it. The only downfall is that it is big, and rear facing will not fit in all vehicles properly. For those saying that it doesn't recline enough. There is a line right on the carseat saying how far it should recline, and if your seat doesn't recline it far enough, which it probably won't, you must put pool noodles under it to make it recline, or it isn't safe. It reclines much further than my evenflo, and my daughter likes it far better. As for taking it apart, there are a lot of steps, but the manual shows you step by step how to do it, and it isn't too tough. I love it. The reason it is so big, is because it works until your child is 100 pounds. If you want a carseat that will last that long, you have to deal with the size. Also, I have never had a problem with the staps twisting.",X_train

1230,"I have owned Britax products before and love them! I think my favorite has been their car seats; they are by far the safest out there.<br /><br />I have been using this stroller since early fall for walks around the neighborhood. I live in a quiet area that with no outlet and am able to take long walks. I have only used this stroller for one (my daughter); I have not purchased any of the attachments that you can add to it. However, the stroller alone is incredible!<br /><br />I thought the stroller was going to be a bit more compact than it was but it is a decent size and weight. It sits up at a comfortable height for my daughter and also me. My step father who joins us on walks finds the height comfortable as well, not adjustments are needed. My daughter usually falls asleep on walks and the fact that you have 4 options for reclining comes in so handy! The wheels are whisper quiet so if she is asleep you do not hear much noise coming from the stroller itself, it is really smooth. I like the fact that it does not have a snack tray on it like some of her other strollers had. I find they get messy and also the tray is usually one height and gets in the way. The storage area is big enough for a diaper bag or for putting your coat or umbrella in it if needed. I like that you can get into the storage area from all sides, a lot of them you can only get into from the back. Even though the color is black it did not seem to attract a lot of heat. However, I did use it when it was not very hot outside but milder weather.<br /><br />I have received a lot of compliments from neighbors about the stroller asking what brand it is. The minute I tell them the brand they shake their head like they knew it could only be Britax.<br /><br />I have not had to store mine therefore have not had to fold it up. I keep it open in the garage since it is big enough for everything but fast enough just to grab for daily walks. I keep another one (different brand) in the trunk of my car for trips out.<br /><br />Last but not least, I love the harness system. The stroller I have in the car for travel has a terrible harness. Britax has always made great harness systems, I love the one in my daughter's car seat, and it is very secure and holds your child in.<br /><br />So far I have not had any issues. This is being used weekly and I cannot think of one thing I dislike about it. It truly is top of the line. The fact that you can expand this for the use of a second child is great for growing families. However, I just have one and plan to keep it that way but it is nice to have the option to add to it.out.<br /><br />Last but not least, I love the harness system.

So I thought I'd roast them and see if that helped, and it didn't.  It was as if I was trying to like them but something was just 'off'.  At this point I had roasted them and wasn't sure if I could return them after cooking so I just trashed them.  Next day went to Walgreen's and bought Macadamias there and upon eating a few, realized how terribly old these were and that they were probably rancid.  The date on the package for these was mid 2015, so I think the company must have gotten an old, bad shipment and repackaged them in their facility for sale.  Avoid!!!  Waste of $15!!",X_train
1235,This idea is really great especially for small strollers without a lot if storage. If you do have some storage on board it helps save room for other items when shopping or in trips.

1236,"My daughter had thrush and so the doctor recommended sterilizing her bottles. Reading through the reviews on this one I was kind of concerned since a lot of people say it started to rust, but I can safely say after five months we have not had that problem. I think the mistake people are making is that after each use you need to wipe off the heating element in the bottom. Letting standing water sit on metal is going to produce rust, so just wipe it off.<br /><br />The only negative I have to say is that it doesn't fit Dr. Brown 8 ounce bottles well. If you sterilize them you need to also use the top part and then balance it on top of the dr brown bottles. It's not ideal but I think it works well enough.",X_train

1238,"My wife and I are the proud parents of an 8-month old little boy and have been successfully making our own baby food since slowly introducing solids at around the 5-6 month mark. The Infantino Squeeze Station came highly recommended from a friend who specializes in early childhood development. We also attended a baby food making class (free at a local grocery store) where again the Infantino was recommended and actually used during the class. We were impressed enough with the product to order our own immediately.<br /><br />--------------------<br />SETUP:<br /><br />There is not a lot to the Squeeze Station, in fact after using the device it quickly became a, &#34;why didn't I think of that&#34; type of scenario. The entire station is made from a nice durable plastic; the top and bottom are coated in a rubber-type material that makes it easier to grip and less likely to slip on counter-tops and tables. There are four major components; the squeeze station stand, the plastic screw-on cylinders, the push plunger, and the food pouches.<br /><br />The entire system is pretty straight forward and extremely easy to setup and start filling pouches with food that you make right in your kitchen!<br /><br />--------------------<br />USE:<br /><br />Having made use of the Squeeze Station for several months here are some general tips and guidelines:<br /><br />• Make sure to properly and thoroughly puree whatever food your making. I cannot stress this point enough as it will save you frustration and potentially a large mess in you kitchen/prep area. The opening between the plastic screw on cylinder and the food pouch is very small to guard against large food chunks passing into the food pouch. This serves to help ensure your baby won't be introduced to large pieces of food that could pose a choking hazard.<br /><br />• Certain foods are harder to process than others and thus end up clogging the food cylinder. Sweet potatoes (one of my son's favorites) requires a lot of steaming and then pureeing to ensure the correct consistency. Others are super simple, particularly apples, pears, banana and other soft fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />• We've found that peeling fruits & vegetables is a must before attempting to puree and using the Squeeze Station.<br /><br />• The plastic cylinders have a fill line, be conscious of that or you may overfill the food pouch only to have the food ooze back out once disconnected from the squeeze station.<br /><br />• The plunger forms a very tight fit inside the cylinder and after squeezing the food in the pouch be sure to unscrew the cylinder before removing the plunger. The vacuum seal will pull food right back out of the pouch if you attempt to remove the plunger first.<br /><br />• Despite your best efforts you're likely to make a mess when using this product. It's to be expected and part of the process and fun of making your own baby food. The entire system is extremely easy to clean so that's a huge bonus.<br /><br />• Have several large bowls on hand - we have one bowl to catch the food peeling, another to hold food that's prepped and going in our steamer, another few bowls to pour food into after pureeing.<br /><br />• The pouches have an area on the front for writing the contents and date. We generally freeze anywhere from 20-30 pouches of food at one time and write the expiration date rather than the prepared date. We generally make the expiration date 3-months out from the preparation date, less for proteins. The pouches are marker or Sharpie friendly but should be completely dry before attempting to write on them!<br /><br />• Defrosting is very easy, we use a large coffee mug with warm water and place the food pouch in the mug. Defrosting varies by the food but generally ready to eat in about 15-minutes.<br /><br />• The squeeze station only comes with 10 pouches and caps in the box. Be sure to pick up an extra box of pouches and caps. It's handy to have a lot of these on hand when making a large amount of food as pouches tend to fill quickly!<br /><br />We have successfully made a large variety of foods for our little boy using the Squeeze Station including: sweet potatos, peas, apples, pears, banana, avocado, plums, butternut and acorn squash. We've even started introducing some proteins including pureed chicken with herbs like parsley.<br /><br />--------------------<br />WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE SQUEEZE STATION:<br /><br />(+) I like knowing exactly what my son is eating. I've never been comfortable with store bought baby foods and have avoided them entirely for my son.<br /><br />(+) The entire system is easy to clean and is dishwasher safe.<br /><br />(+) The system is inexpensive and the pouches while not reusable are recyclable.<br /><br />(+) Extremely easy to store and transport the food pouches for when you're on the go.<br /><br />(+) Squeeze the food directly from the pouch to a spoon thus making less of a mess at feeding time.<br /><br />(+) My son absolutely loves the food we make him. Combining different foods from pouches is also a hit, e.g. sweet potato and chicken.<br /><br />--------------------<br />WHAT I DISLIKE ABOUT THE SQUEEZE STATION:<br /><br />(-) Can be frustrating at times when a food chunk becomes stuck in the cylinder several times and after repeated pureeing.<br /><br />(-) You will make a mess in your prep area.<br /><br />--------------------<br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />If you're looking at making your own baby food this is an easy recommendation. The entire system is inexpensive and very easy to use and clean. If the pouches seem expensive be sure to shop around. Many local retailers such as BuyBuy Baby and Baby's R Us carry this line of products and coupled with coupons/sales you can easily find great deals!e amount of food as pouches tend to fill quickly!<br /><br />We have successfully made a large variety of foods for our little boy using the Squeeze Station including: sweet potatos, peas, apples, pears, banana, avocado, plums, butternut and acorn squash.

We are very pleased by the purchase and we would recommend it because:<br /><br />- Our child loves riding it.  Although it looks narrow, the seating space is wide and the multiple adjustments for the reclining seat are great.<br /><br />- It is very light and compact, yet with enough space at the bottom.<br /><br />- Extremely easy to maneuver.  We tested other strollers and we are still amazed at how easily and smoothly it rolls.<br /><br />- Compact and easy to fold.  We bought the travel bag for easy storage when traveling; makes it very easy to carry.<br /><br />- Although some reviewers complain that the seat covers are not washable, this is not a problem for us, since we don't feed our kid snacks on the go on a regular basis.  We did have a little chocolate ice cream accident, and the material cleaned up easily with a damp cloth.<br /><br />Overall, we would recommend this stroller to anybody who appreciates smart, minimalist yet  functional design, and does not want to feel like they are pushing a truck when taking baby out for a stroll.",X_train

1257,"Bought this camera back in January and was so pleased with it I bought a second add on camera!<br /><br />We have three children and I never thought about getting a Video monitor until our two daughters would be sharing a room.(ages 2, newborn) Our biggest concern was the newborn's crib. I was worried my two year old would want to climb in with her or try to throw things in with her and I wanted to make sure I had an eye on them! This works great and I'm able to see exactly what I set out to see. Now we have one for my sons room as well (age 3)<br /><br />The Monitor is light weight. Picture comes in clear both daytime and night time. Settings are extremely simple to use. Now that we have two cameras I can switch back and forth between the two very easily. The Camera picks up the noises I need to hear(kids) and I don't have any interference! (we had been having issues with interference on an audio monitor we owned previously through another company.) Love the power save mode where the video screen turns off until there is activity. You can do the same with audio. There is a warning for low battery too. Easy to put up!<br /><br />I would buy this monitor again! The price is right and it does exactly what I need.<br /><br />More importantly the Infant Optics Support Team is AMAZING!<br />About a month after having our first camera, it stopped working. I emailed the Tech team and was so surprised and pleased to receive and email the same day back! From a real person! Turned out to be a faulty cord. They sent me a new cord in a matter of a few days.

1265,This toy seemed to have the most toys on it- I was so excited for my son to play in it...My son is 6 months old and already is at the tallest setting- that is the first issue-there should be more room to grow.  The biggest issue is the toys are hard and some are pointed...my son in 1 second ( quicker then I could grab him-I was right in front of him) smashed his head into the book and the spiral part of the book left an imprint/welt/egg on his head-he cried and I wanted to :(...the phone could do some damage too- He i sokay- just a minor boo-boo- but a big scare.

I have never liked honey, but Manuka does go down well and hopefully has the health benefits widely reported on line!",X_train
1271,My nearly 1 year old daughter loves this seat.  I have it rear facing in a 2008 Rav4 and even fits front facing in a 2002 RSX coupe.  It's slightly smaller size has worked out perfectly.  Installation is easy with the LATCH system. I'll have to wait to see if the 40lb limit Vs. the Marathon's 65lb limit will make a difference.  At that point I'm thinking a booster will suffice.,X_train

1273,"Things not to like; it's made of pretty thin metal, easy to bend. It's kinda smallish, probably could have used the larger one but not at nearly twice the price.<br />Things to like; it holds the leashes and more. The color I picked somewhat matches the decor. Mounting holes are good but I used some black painted screws to mount so that plain silver screws wouldn't be staring you in the face. I t would have been nice if they had painted the screws to match. It's cute and our dogs love to go for a walk.",X_train

These crackers have apparently been re-engineered and now resemble the previous product only in geometry and the presence of (assumed) rosemary.  They are dense, hard and dry as dust in the mouth.  They taste overcooked.  The old flavor that we liked so much is completely absent.  Badly done, Suzie.  Very badly done indeed.",X_train

1277,We just got it about 2 weeks ago. And I love it. My son used to sleep in a travel bed and is now curled up in a corner because its so big for him. I truly can recommend it cuz it come with all the quipment to transform it into a toddler and day bed. The only thing that you have to purchase later on is the bedrails but oh well that has time until this needs to be done. The only problem that my occure is acutally to put it together since the manuall is confusing. I received about 3 different one and the it takes a while to figure out which screw is which. But besides that I love that crib....,X_train

I am able to buy this in my local store for $5.39, but if I couldn't I would pay the online price to get it.Slice some pork shoulder or boneless country style ribs (or use pork belly from a Chinese store). Marinate in this sauce. i add sliced onions, garlic and green onions to mine. I cook it fast and hot on a griddle. We eat it wrapped in lettuce leaves with a smear of tasty Korean paste (soybean paste, red pepper paste, dash of sesame oil, dash of sugar). This brand's bulgogi marinade is excellent, too. I don't bother making my own Korean marinade anymore - I just use these.",X_train

But those are the only ways.  If you like raw eggs in a drink such as egg nog, here is the way to have that without worrying about some disease in the raw eggs. Cook them any way you like, combine them in any recipe you want and they are good eggs.

One or two you could just say it was a fluke, but five?  Luckily we've been able to return them every time so we've only ever paid for two.

1302,"My 5-year-old son was thrilled with this lunchbox, and immediately decorated it to his liking with the included stickers.  That is about where the delight ended!    Even though we read carefully the included instructions on how to put the top on the lunchbox and practiced faithfully, he could never get it on himself, despite working really hard at it.  I had a difficult time myself, and his teacher at school has never been able to get it on, despite my trying to teach her how.  He carries the lunchbox out of school flat, with the lid just resting on the top because no one at school can get it back on after lunchtime.    After the lid (mistakenly) went through the dishwasher once (with NO heated dry, only wash), the lid is now impossible for even me to seal.  It warped on one side.    We are disappointed in this purchase, and my son just gets sad every time he sees that cool lunchbox that he will never use again.  He had been so excited about it.    I recommend that you do a little more research and purchase a different item.",X_train

I did some research & it opened my beautiful browns. Is there anything out there that Big Corp hasn't ruined?<br />When my 1st order came, evidently the packaging had not been sealed correctly & there was salt all over the place. I contacted the company & they graciously sent me a duplicate order. No charge. No questions asked. Meantime I gather the salt & begin my adventure. Oh my, I had no idea salt had a flavor! I couldn't stop tasting it. Aztec Sea Salt is a GORgeous addition to my spice table. I cook w/it. I finish w/it. I bake w/it. I dry some to put in my salt grinder & to have some available when I bake which I grind w/a mortar & pestle. It lends such a brightness to food without that dusty saltiness. It's not just...salt: It's substantial & has weight & I love the fact that it's fair trade. This company has the kind of integrity that I can support & a product that I can feel really, really good about. Will I tell my friends? I do.",X_train

It was also useful in the car when propped up in her car seat (at the right distance of course) when she was getting fussy.

1315,"This monitor worked great for just over the 2 years we've had it. Liked the &#34;walky-talky&#34; function, and the normal monitor function worked fine for listening to my daughter when sleeping. Right before the two year mark of using it, one of the receivers/parent unit quit working. It acted like it was trying to connect, but no sound came through. I still used the other unit for her naps so I could do yardwork and be able to hear if she was awake, but now the second unit has gone kaput! This time all the lights light up but no sound or anything. We've taken it apart, detached the battery, and still neither one work.<br />The base unit has a blue night light feature, which is helpful when needing to see in the dark, and my daughter now likes it as a night light for under her bed. It was too bright to have out in the open though, would keep her awake when she was a baby.<br />Bummed this did not last longer. Good monitor if not planning on long-term use!",X_train

I made the mistake of thinking I could use my Amazon Prime Membership to move into supplying more of my home groceries over to Amazon.  I thought I could find brands that I liked.  Now I'm going to provide unwitting Amazon shoppers with a warning so that they don't spend $43.39 for three  tins of tea.  By the way, My order page listed these teas as costing &#34;$0.00 (ZERO)&#34; dollars until AFTER they were delivered.

When I started on the HCG diet, I was afraid that food would get boring in a hurry, but Bragg Liquid Aminos Marinade really adds to flavors.  It reminds me of a mixture of soy sauce, Worcestershire, and liquid smoke, all rolled into one.  I put it on everything, and I mean everything, from salads to meats.  The large size was perfect for me, since I shared with my daughter-in-law who also went through the diet with me.

I don't have to worry about leaving things in for too long, or getting things too hot and melting them like stovetop sterilizing.  I also don't have to fish things out of hot water.  I just easily load it up, pour in the water, and turn it on.  8 minutes later everything is sterile.  It is big enough to fit a lot of items at once too.  Its larger size is the reason I chose it over the microwave sterilizer from Avent, although I'm told it is wonderful too.  I highly recommend this sterilizer!

We bought this carrier to try it out in hopes it would do better than all the others we had tried. It's fantastic! My son loves sitting in it (and he's a busy boy who'd rather be running). His weight doesn't pull on my shoulders like others because it's designed just like a backpack with a strap around the hips where all the weight is distributed. I was worried that my figure wouldn't allow me to snap the buckle across the chest, but it isn't even needed. I haven't tried washing it yet, we've only used it four times. Hopefully it will hold up in a washing and cleaning, but I might even dry clean this just so it will last longer. I love it.",X_train

1359,"This chair is meant to be a lower cost alternative to the popular tripp-trapp chair. It is close, but the design just does not cut it. In fact, at times this chair is unsafe.<br />The lower foot rest portion of the chair, when placed in position for a larger child is only held loosely into its groove, causing the foot rest to fall out all the time. Seldom is one of our mealtimes not interrupted by my youngest daughter's foot rest clattering to the floor. The seat is better, but prone to the same movement and she has fallen a couple of times as the seat has become displaced. I guess the seat portion moves less because of the added weight on the seat (as opposed to the lower weight, but greater movement to which a foot rest is subjected).<br />Overall, nice idea, really poor implementation. Spend the extra $100 and get the Tripp Trapp.",X_train
1360,"I bought this bedrail a couple weeks ago after looking around at different retailers. I could not find an Extra Long bedrail for under $29.99. This one was very simple to set up. There were no tools required just plugged the ends of the metal frame together and thats about it. Took me about a total of 10 minutes. Would also suggest reading instructions or at least giving them a glance over. The bedrail is very easy to use and swings down that allows me to change the sheets and make the bed. This thing is sturdy too and has held up to some pretty wild kids.

The day I got the chair I was so excited! Took it out of the box and put it all together (took just a few min). I started playing with it and boy was I disappointed; to recline the chair you pull this plastic lever in the back of the seat, when I was pulling the lever it was sticking and the chair would also stick reclining, I did it a few more times and the plastic lever totally broke off. Honestly to pay 200 bucks for plastic that sticks is a big disappointment!

One choice might be SBC's Twilight Decaf, which is actually a pretty pleasant coffee that brews a rich, smoky but not burnt flavor. Some folks swear by Starbuck's Decaf Verona which I do not like as much as SBC.     Then this came along...

1387,"I'm not the type to write reviews but this product warranted one. I also wanted to clear up some confusion. As another reviewer previously stated, please do not rate this product badly when you clearly are using it wrong. As with all Avent nipples, there is a fine, almost invisible line on the edge of the nipple. The proper way to position the nipple on the white screw ring is to make sure the fine line lands between the gap of the three screw lines under the white screw ring..got it? So if you're done cleaning the nipple and you're ready to put the nipple through the screw ring, make sure the line on the nipple lands in the gap of the screw lines under the screw ring.<br /><br />After you position the nipple, place the adapter bottle ring on the bottle and then tighten the screw ring on top. If you do this properly, there will be zero leaks. With this mouthful said, i do agree that Avent should make it easier to use their bottles without leaks. They should also tell you how to do this (i figured it out after doing a Google search because the packaging didn't say this).<br /><br />On to the variable flow nipple...<br /><br />My son has severe reflux and the doctors at the hospital where he went after a scary incident said to add rice to his cereal and to cut the tops of the nipples so the breast milk would flow easier. This worked for approximately two months until the holes became so wide because of the cleaning that my son started to choke on his milk. I found these nipples and they work great! The flow (when the III mark is towards his nose) is fast enough where my son doesn't get frustrated when sucking but not so fast that he chokes on the milk.<br /><br />My gripes?

I'm planning to write a letter to Cosco complaining that their product doesn't come with a safe bumper for infants.  The sheets fit fine, btw.

1402,"I was at my local health food store the other day and saw these. They seemed interesting so I thought I'd give them a try. Wow! I just loved them! The avocado oil gives them a more deep, well-rounded flavor than the regular potato chips that you'd get at the store. The chips are also of a decent thickness so you get a crunch without it being too much, but also without it being just a slight crispiness. I haven't eaten Lay's in a long time but I remember them being thinner and Terra Chips being a lot thicker -- these are in-between. In my mind, it's the perfect thickness. They aren't too salty, but also aren't lacking in salt. I've bought bags of Beanitos wherein some of the chips didn't seem to have salt at all -- I didn't have this problem with these chips. Another thing -- and really the selling point for me -- was that I just felt better eating these. I don't have a problem eating the occasional junk food so it's not that. I really think that maybe the avocado oil might just add some mineral/vitamin aspect to things that just makes my body feel better -- that's my theory anyway. I can't say that everyone will feel this way (my body is certainly not what I'd call &#34;normal&#34; in its reaction to foods), but I felt it was important to mention that these just make me feel good to eat. That's why I purchased a giant 12-pack.

When I purchased them in the health food store, the image shown in this listing was the style of the packaging, however, when buying them on Amazon, the packaging was different. They're still the same, delicious chips, but just in a different bag. Also, though I'm not sure anyone will care about this, but when I ordered mine, the box used to ship them was a box which read &#34;Good Health Kettle Style Potato Chips&#34; -- so if you care about others knowing what you're buying, be warned that it's possible that this will be right out in the open. I didn't mind but I realize some people do.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that these chips are really my new favorites. I don't think I've ever purchased a 12-pack of chips before. I'm more of a sweets person than a salty snack person, in general, but these I just fell in love with. I wouldn't just recommend them to others, I'd buy them for parties, keep them in the house for guests, and gladly share with friends.

1434,I just recieved this bra and I was scared to order a xs-m size because pre pregnancy I was a 34DD and I have no idea what size I am not but at  7 months my size has really gone up. This bra is really adjustable and fits very well. It has a velcro adjustable piece in the back and an extra add on piece in the front if you need it also comes with straps if you need that extra support. Personally I made the back piece smaller and added the extra piece up front with the straps and the openings for the pump are in the right places.I haven't pumped with the bra on yet as I still have 3 months left in my pregnancy but the bra is very comfortable thick and holds the pump in place with great security.,X_train
1435,"I bought this 2 months ago. I LOVED it, at first. The opening is wide enough that I can carry a sleeping baby through it without banging my hip on it. I didn't think it would be secure, but it really was! My 3 and 4 year old figured out how to open it within a few days, but it wasn't an issue because it was to keep my baby from climbing the stairs. It was nice that the older kids could operate it so I didn't have to come running every time they wanted to go to their rooms. The reason I only gave this 3 stars is because of 2 reasons.<br />Within a month of having it, the auto close feature stopped working. It wouldn't slam shut after opening. I don't know why this is. The second reason is because after having it for 2 months, my daughter opened the gate and hung on it. It snapped at the hinge. I know this is my daughters fault, however I feel it is Munchkins fault too. The entire gate is metal, and the closures are plastic. If you look at the picture, the top right hinge (the side that doesn't open) is plastic inside, not metal. Therefore wasn't as sturdy as it could have been. I think if they replaced that plastic with metal (on the inside) it would be near indestructible and worthy of 5 stars.",X_train

1544,"This is the third monitor we've owned, and it is by far, the best. It has many of the typical features: clear, great range, long battery life, and compact size. It also allows the parent to communicate with a child (parent unit can broadcast to the baby unit (walkie-talkie style). Of course, many of the features are common to other monitors, and are all advertised/included in the product details.<br /><br />However, what makes this a great unit are two features that aren't emphasized/included in the product details.<br /><br />1. The loop on the baby unit can be set to serve as a night light. When enabled, any noise causes the loop to light up, providing a soft light for your child. After some time, the light dims off. What is really nice, is that this feature can be enabled/disabled remotely from the parent unit!<br /><br />2. Probably the BEST feature of this device is that the baby unit will return to \\""on\\"" following a power failure. We have frequent lightning storms (Texas) that sometimes cause power outages. With most monitors we've used, you must go into the child's room to turn on the baby unit following a power outage. The VTech Safe & Sound Digital Audio Monitor returns to the on position following a power outage. This is my favorite feature, and I only discovered this after a power outage. I am surprised that I could not find this feature in any of the online descriptions, and I will only purchase monitors that have this feature in the future.<br /><br />Overall it is a solid product that, for the most part, is very similar to other products on the market. However, the added benefit of the parent unit controlled nightlight, and the \\""return to on\\"" following a power outage set this monitor head-and-shoulders above the competition.",X_train
1545,"They packed the block in tons of bubble wrap and related materials, but it needs something more or different.  The block weighs a lot and salt is fragile, a terrible combination for shipping.  So I would be shocked if almost anyone receives an undamaged block (at least with the packing used on mine).  The block itself is pretty nice.  It has the general colors and patterns you see in the photos, but since you will use it laying on a counter, there's no light source behind it, so it looks very flat and uninteresting compared to the photos shown on Amazon.  It looks a lot like soapstone or alabaster do when they aren't illuminated from behind.

Especially here in a cold climate, if she has her coat on, it's tough to get her buckled in, and if she has her snow pants on, forget about getting her buckled.

1556,"My baby is 5 months old.  When I was pregnant I bought a regular/standard diaper bag, with winnie the pooh on it, from a department store.  At the time I just thought, \\""oh its so cute for a baby!\\"".  That diaper bag is big, but with hardly any pockets.  I've quickly realized that I needed something better.  My main goal when setting out to shop for a new diaper bag was that I wanted something that could double as my purse, so that when we go out I do not need to bring the diaper bag AND the purse.  I have 3 kids in all, so the less I have to bring the better!    When I opened my package today I was pleasantly surprised at the size of this bag!  I wanted something smaller then the diaper bag I have.  When we go out I bring:  change of clothes for my baby, 5-6 diapers, wipes, 2-3 burp cloths, a couple bibs, 2 bottles, can of formula, and his jared food if we'll be gone near mealtimes.  Also: a couple of toys and his \\""bankey\\"". We don't bring a ton of stuff, so when I was debating between this bag and the bigger, more expensive skip hop bag (the 80-90 dollar one), I chose this one as I wanted one that was smaller, but (hopefully not) too small.  Being too small was the only thing I was nervous about when I ordered this bag.  When I opened the package I was very impressed that it was actually bigger then I was expecting!  Not too big/huge, but not so small and compact that you can't put hardly anything in it.  To test it out, I filled it with all of what I listed above and it fits great!  It also has pockets for mom stuff - In addition to the baby items I was able to add my wallet, keys, cell phone, lip gloss, pen, and my Kindle and could certainly fit more if needed.  Inside one of the pockets in the front of the bag is a clip for hooking a set of keys too - very nice extra touch.  everything is so much more organized! I've seen people complain about the magnetic closure- by Idk why?!  There is two rows of metal discs....if the bag is fuller, you use the one closer to the top of the flat - and its stays shut very securely.     I also tested out the clips to hook this bag to our stroller. We have a Graco snugride infant seat/stroller travel system.  Hooking this to the stroller was so easy, and still does not get in the way of the handle bar.  I absolutely love this feature!  Also, the should strap has a very nice and comfortable pad on it and the strap is adjustable.  The material the bag is made out of seems very durable and of much better quality then cheaper/other bags out there. Oh, and the bag includes a changing pad that folds up/and velcros shut.     Overall, I am absolutely THRILLED with this purchase. I looked here on amazon for what seemed like hours before finally choosing a bag and I am very, very happy with it.  I'm already very happy with this and have not even really used it yet.  I will def. be recommending this bag/company to others.",X_train

1558,"I am not one to write a review, but the Evenflo high chair is so dangerous and the company so negligent, that I had to let others know.  The Evenflo Majestic Highchair has recently, finally, been recalled.  We had issues with the screws popping out of the recliner section of the chair when we used it with our then 6 month old, I called Evenflo last March, they sent me a repair kit with longer screws, still didn't work. Customer service had told me then this was not a common problem and that even with a screw missing, highchair was safe to use, not dangerous. I'm so furious they lied about my son's safety!!!!! Our longer screws did pop out a few times, we put them back in, I called back and since the highchair still held up fine and they told me it was okay to use, we wrongly trusted Evenflo and continued to use the highchair (my husband had checked it and felt is was okay). I just called in response to last weeks recall and they said they do have a record of me calling, sorry that happened and would I like a new set of screws? They won't give a refund and the new screws (which they will ship out in approx. 2 weeks, and recommend we don't use the highchair in the meantime) supposedly work better than the original replacements. I am returning this to the store, and if they won't accept the return, I'll have to eat the cost and throw out the chair.  We've had so many of our kids' things recalled, it's infuriating that these companies only have to send screws that may or may not work and before their belated recalls, our kids are at risk and to boot this time they assured me there was no danger. Please do not buy Evenflo and know that you can't trust the info you receive from customer service.     I'm am so thankful my son wasn't injured. We've had other issues with most of our Evenflo products not working correctly, but all involving bells and whistles not structual. I just can't understand how these companies put more money into their impossible to open packaging thaninto their product safety.",X_train

They dont leak at the seal at all. They came with plastic inserts that I assume would help with this but our goal was not leak &#34;proof&#34; but spill resistant so we did not use them. Four stars because, like all of these bottle and accessories, they are overpriced (but still obviously worth it for me). Even though they are all expensive, if you use them from baby bottle stage to sippy stage to regular water bottle stage with just a cap, the value is pretty good.

1570,"This Heinz tartar sauce, luckily, is sold at local supermarkets here in South Florida. I decided to compare as many tartar sauces as I could find locally in supermarkets; there were 4 major brands: Heinz, Hellmann's, Kraft, and McCormick; a couple of off brands: Bennett's and Louisiana; and Whole Foods Market 365 tartar sauce. The McCormick tarter sauce has a slightly more mustardy taste than the others, which I like, sort of like a mayonnaise-based non-sweet honey mustard sauce with pickle undertones; it is fresh tasting, and comes in glass bottles (Amazon seems to only offer the fat free version which I haven't tried, nor do I care to). Heinz has a nicely balanced pickle relish taste that doesn't overpower the mayonnaise base; I put it in a tie with McCormick for first place; 365 has a less mayonnaisey, lighter flavor that highlights the fresh pickle taste--I rate it in the top three. I didn't care for the Hellmann's, and the two off brands mentioned were gross, and I don't mean I brought 12 dozen of them. The Kraft seemed to have an artificial flavor, and it does list artificial flavor as an ingredient. By the way, the Heinz tarter sauce includes alum as an ingredient; alum is an aluminum containing compound; research indicates that, supposedly, very little is absorbed through the digestive tract, but those concerned about this might, well, be concerned. However, as far as taste, Heinz tartar sauce is one of the top two or three, in my opinion.",X_train

1603,"The problem with these candies which I love, is that somewhere in the process of production and shipping some of them melt and it becomes difficult to unwrap. Sometimes small little chips fall out during the unwrapping and the consumer being unaware of this, finds pieces sticking to clothing which are most difficult to remove. They stick like glue. Secondly, the espresso especially, never tastes the same as a previous order. Sometimes they have a wonderful, slightly strong espresso flavor,other times almost flavorless.<br />This is probably mostly the manufacturers fault. Do they change the recipe for making this stuff?<br />I think most of the complaint is with the manufacturer. Someone should let them know.",X_train

Depending on how the chair arms shift when you tighten the clamps, it can be a little hard to get it into place, but with a bit of fiddling, you can get it to fit.<br /><br />It does cause some pretty deep gouges in the plastic of the arms, but it's just cosmetic.",X_train

I know from past family experience with the First Years Eden dolls, that it will continue to be a favorite for years to come.  They are a very high quality product and worth the price.  It is soft, cushiony and has very well stitched seams all over.  With the past boy dolls our family has had, I know that it stands up to many years of machine washing and drying also.  The only part on this particular doll I'm not sure of yet because this style is new, is whether the bow, little satin neck trim and hair will be as resilient in the years to come.  I have high hopes that it will and have purchased them in the past and will again anytime a baby gift is needed.",X_train

1620,"Though I generally review entertainment products on Amazon I do occasionally review food products and after returned from the Fancy Food Show in New York , this product was sent to me by the manufacturer for an objective review.<br /><br />This was one of a number of products from the Back To the Roots brand. As they say on their label, they like to keep it simple. I was really impressed. The flavor I got \\""Blueberries, Almonds & Buckwheat\\"" is not on Amazon currently but I hope you'll have an idea of what to expect by my posting this review of that flavor. The FULL ingredients list for this product - at least the flavor I got)  is simply: Organic Buckwheat seeds, Organic Almonds, Organic Blueberries (freeze-dried). That's it! Nothing artificial or even the words \\""natural flavor).<br /><br />The product can be used a number of ways and I tried a few. I added some to the wonderful Stoneground flakes cereal that BTTR makes (see my review on Amazon) and they don't add a lot of calories and you get 3g of fiber per portion. The cereal itself gives you 5g of fiber. So together you get 8g of fiber and only 240 calories at most.<br /><br />I also added to plain nonfat yogurt to make a tasty- health snack. There are 80 calories and 2g of \\""healthy\\"" fat in one 3 tbsp. serving and the container has 8 servings (but I didn't need 3 tbsp for the yogurt - or, frankly, for the cereal.<br /><br />I had never heard of BTTR but- based on these two products, I like their philosophy as well as the products and I'm glad I found them.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm",X_train

1622,"Let me say this first:  our family of 6 keeps a high protein, low carb diet, and we eat a lot of jerky each month ( avg 30 lbs).   We have tried a vast majority of jerky out there, and can tell a good jerky from bad.  I have no idea how can anyone leave this jerky a positive, not to mention gleaming review.   Must be the first time trying jerky.  FIRST:  there is NOTHING natural about this jerky.  Few noticed, but their packaging used to say \\""all natural\\"", but NO MORE, because they know it is not.  Now it says \\"" naturally hickory smoked\\"", or the like.   WHO CARES.   your jerky has so much cr_p in it that naturally smoking it makes no difference.  This jerky is full of salt.  this jerky is packed with MSG - and i mean PACKED!!!  This jerky is quite greasy. NOTE:  Bulk packaging ( 1 lb bags) are a bit better than smaller bags, and meat type in bulk bags is different.  YES< this company has absolutely zero consistency.  If you take 20 chunks out of a bulk bag, you will see that there are 4-5 different kinds of meats there.  some wil be moist and chewy, others will be nothing but rubber, some with thick tendons running through, and some are quite marbled.  Just when you find a piece to your liking - you are back searching for a lucky chunk again.  smaller bags, especially teriyaki is very greasy and has so much coating that you taste all the chemicals way before you get to meat flavor ( if you can call it that).     i'd give this jerky a 2 if there was meat consistency, but its a total crap shoot.   you can find LOTS of other - better tasting jerky in the same price range, here on amazon.   even the middle of the road obertos is much better than this stuff.  WILD RIDE JERKY IS A JOKE and IS GROSS.  Buy at your own risk, but know that you are buying a truly chemically processed and preserved jerky - full of MSG and 0ther additives.     OH, and those 1 lb cowboy stips bags?  Well,  there was exactly 10 oz of strips in a bag - rest was jerky shavings and bitsNpieces - similar to what oberto sells as bulk packages salad topper shavings of jerky - NO STRIPS!!!  we tried every flavor in their bulk=-packaged variety and this holds true for every single package.",X_train

Btw, this seems to be mostly a Toy Story 1 themed backpack, none of the bigger characters for 2 or 3 are represented and the Buzz on the back isn't one of those shifty 3D images, it just flat and static.

With my first child I used a cheaper, inferior pram caddy product - my coffee spilt every time in the small cup holders because the straps holding it to the pram were flimsy and the caddy swung and moved with the pram. With the arrival of baby number 2, I have been looking for something more substantial and the StarPack Stroller Mate is perfect.<br /><br />I love how sturdy it it when it attaches to the pram. And I am yet to spill a drink.<br /><br />The amount of storage is amazing - plenty of room for two drinks, wallet, keys, phone, snacks and nappies.<br /><br />The detachable purse is really handy too. Often I've found myself wheeling the whole pram around the playground to keep my valuables close-by, but the detachable purse means I can just zip off the section with my money, keys and phone.<br /><br />I have recommended this product to the mums in my mothers group, and it would also make a great present for mums because of its flexible design (meaning it can attach to almost any type of pram without being on an angle).<br /><br />Overall, it is a great design and has been manufactured to a high standard (much much higher than my old one) and is great value for money.<br />Thanks again!",X_train
1653,"I have been using the blanched almond flour from Honeyville, but what I don't like about that brand is that it feels more grainy and granular when used – it just isn't finely ground enough to pass as a flour in recipes. So I was absolutely delighted when this brand sent me a bag of their almond flour to test, and I opened it up to find that it has a much finer texture than Honeyville. It really feels fluffy and light, like a real flour, unlike almost every brand I've tried in the past. Having a blanched flour in a fine grain like this is a godsend when making paleo pancakes, cookies, and coatings over baked chicken. I will absolutely continue to purchase this brand now that I've discovered it. It also has a particularly fresh flavor in comparison to other brands I've purchased. It has that wonderful nutty fresh almond flavor, and I'm even considering trying to make marzipan or something with it, because I'm inspired by the flavor.",X_train

There have been no problems with it at all, no tears, snags, or anything of sorts.  It looks good and no one would ever think that it's a diaper bag.  I've gotten compliments before from younger girls in their 20's who like this style.  When I tell them it's a diaper bag they immediately ask the brand and say they'll keep it in mind for later :)<br /><br />When I first had my baby, I got the Charlie II bag and back then being a first time mom who carried a pump and everything else daily, the bag was good and served the purpose but it wasn't very good looking and parts started falling apart very quickly.<br /><br />When my daughter got a little older and I didn't need to carry so much stuff - plus I had gotten a handle on being a mom - I switched to this bag.  It's perfect for when you're out of the newborn stage and need to carry less.  Plus the ability to wear it around you frees up your hands which we all know is a must once your little once becomes mobile.<br /><br />I'm still using it now and my daughter is 2.  It's perfect if I just want to put a diaper in the bag with some wipes and a cream.

1691,"I think that Beech-Nut Organic Stage 2 Purees - Just Apple, Raspberry & Avocado are great! The color and its amazingly smooth but not runny texture had my baby eating every drop. With it only being pure fruits and veggies with no additives or preservatives I have no problem feeding it to my baby. I also give it a try myself before I feed it to my baby, I can tell 80% of the time if shes going to like it or not. The taste was pretty good, better than most baby foods that I've tried. It also made me feel like a great mom while feeding it to my baby. I've never known a brand so pure and healthy! Best of all I received free by being a bzzagent!

1703,"I love this pump.  I spent a long time trying to decide between this and the Medela Freestyle, and eventually chose this one.  I based that on the reviews I read, as it seemed this one had less people saying it didn't work for them, and since you can't return it, it seemed less risky.   I have not actually used the Freestyle, so can't truly compare, but I LOVE this pump and am 100% happy with my purchase.    The 2 best features of this pump are the memory setting and the power of the motor.  When my daughter was first born, bf'ing was EXTREMELY painful for me.  \\""Sore\\"" was putting it mildly... as I told my mother I found it infinitely more painful than labor (which in all honestly I did not think was that bad - and I had no drugs).  Given the issues I was experiencing on one side in particular, I ended up only feeding her on one side exclusively while I pumped the \\""bad\\"" side for about a week.  Being able to control the strength and rythem of the pump, to minimize pain, was CRUCIAL for me.   Having this pump allowed me to maintain my supply and I am now still going strong 6 months later.    The power of this pump is great.  I also own an Avent Isis Uno (single) pump which I use at home in the morning and there is NO comparison in terms of power.  I can only use the Uno in the morning when I'm completely full, otherwise I get almost nothing.   The duo , on the other hand, is actually more effective than my daughter feeding directly, and has kept my supply up great.  My daughter ate a lot from 3-6 months before she started with solids ... with this pump I was able to pump over 16oz in only 2 sessions at work, each session taking less than 10 minutes.   Before you have a baby, I know this number means nothing, but trust me this is a lot of milk to pump in such a short time.    My only real complaint with this pump WAS that you cannot get spare replacement parts, which is really useful to have at work so you dont have to wash them between sessions (i.e. you can just throwthem all in a bag and bring them home to clean at night), but I called the manufacturer today and you actually CAN order spare parts right off the website now, so that is great!!     One thing I will say that this motor is very heavy.  If you plan to carry the pump back and forth to work every day, I think it's very heavy for that.  This hasn't been a problem for me though since I brought it to work once 3 months ago and have left it there since.      So in summary -- if you are going to bring it to work and leave it there, or use it regularly at home and don't need to carry it around much, you cannot go wrong with this pump.      Extremely comfortable & powerful. However, if you can't handle high power, you can make it as light as you want with the memory feature.  Highly recommended!!",X_train

1707,"As someone who has trashed 3 diaper bags, this one being washable and well made makes it worth the price! My ONLY warning on this bag is that if you have a newborn or more than 1 in diapers, it may not be big enough.  At least it wouldn't have been for me.  I have 1 in diapers and 1 that only needs a sippy cup and a few toys.  I am so happy I found Ju Ju Be bags!  I can fit diapers, wipes, diaper cream, a few small toys, 2 board books, a few snacks, 2 sippy cups, a rubber roll up bib, my keys and phone and a water bottle for me if I don't zip it.  The fuchia blossoms is so pretty and I love that this is washable!  My last diaper bag bit the dust after an apple went bad in it so this is a huge plus for me!  Great features... the organization is outstanding and the pattern and hardware is really great looking.  wearing this cross body really makes things a bit easier for me when I have 2 kids, this bag and my purse. I have to pack size 4 diapers and I really have to push them all the way down in the pocket to zip the bag, not an issue for me but it took a bit of getting used too.

We prefer the milder version for some things, but this is great on pork ribs. We have tried several different rubs and seasonings, but this is just enough spice to make it hot, but very flavorful.<br /><br />For some reason, this does not &#34;cake up&#34; in the container the way the milder version does.

1743,"I have to focus on the aspects that I can detect (taste and smell) and not ones on which I could only speculate (potency of antioxidants).    This tea has very little flavor.  It smells as if it will have a rich, fruity flavor but that is not at all the case.  There is no raspberry in it.  The name of the tea is \\""Green Tea Superfruit (Red Goji and Respberry)\\"".  It contains (green tea, natural flavor, soy lecithin, blueberry juice solids, concentrated goji juice solids)    No raspberry at all... So I guess the \\""natural flavor\\"" is raspberry flavor?  Why not just include raspberry juice solids or concentrated raspberry juice solids?    Anyway, the net here is that it is green tea with a questionable attempt at being true to its name of \\""Red Goji and Raspberry\\""... It does not taste bad, it simply doesn't taste like much at all.  I will continue to drink it (and the other 5 boxes I bought in my six-pack), as there is nothing in the ingredients list that I specifically disapprove of and I will trust the antioxidant counts they provide, that come from the green tea itself.  I might turn it into iced tea in the summer and add lemonade to it so it will have some flavor.    I would not buy this again but would try another variety of Lipton (or other) Green Tea.

1752,"I wanted to love this car seat.  I feel like I really tried.      Our friends swear by Recaro and have used the Como for both of their children, so when we found the Como on sale for more than half its list price, we bought it sight unseen thinking it was going to be the be-all-end-all of convertible car seats.    I don't know if it's the make/model of our car (2003 Ford Taurus) that is making this car seat impossible to work with, but I'm ready to light it on fire.  It sits so high in the back seat (rear-facing) that maneuvering my wiggly 8-month old son into it is a fight every time.  The side-impact protection wings mean that I have to turn him sideways and practically scrape his face on the ceiling of our car to get him in and out of it...which he is obviously not pleased with.  Additionally, the size of this thing is monolithic, and has almost totally occluded my vision out of the car's rear window when placed in the center (as recommended by the CHP)...this, combined with the giant blind spots that are created when I have to check left and right while driving makes me feel like I'm driving with my eyes closed.  Perhaps it's just the slope of the rear window.  Perhaps out car has lower ceilings than others.  Our friends drive an SUV, so perhaps it works fabulously in that scenario.      I also don't feel like it's designed well to stay securely in place.  Even using the LATCH method, it was extremely hard to tighten down the belt and still wiggles all over the place.  I installed a Britax Marathon 70 in my mother's Prius earlier tonight, and it doesn't move a millimeter when secured in place or obscure the driver's vision from the sides or out the rear window.    If I can return it, I'm going to.  If I can't, maybe it's better as a front-facing seat with the additional top anchor in place.  But at this point...I hate our Como with a passion after about 3 weeks of regular use, and my son does too.  Recaro is just not for everyone, I guess.",X_train

We found that if you moisten the suction cup before pressing it down on the tray/table, then it stuck pretty well. They do not suction on to wood, laminate, or any surface that has texture. It sticks best to smooth plastic (like the highchair tray) or glass. The lids are difficult to put on, but once on, they are really secure and do not leak.",X_train

1801,"Fantastic idea, my kids loved it the first few nights.  Unfortunately it's just a cheap piece of junk. The light only stays on for about half an hour before automatically turning off, which causes my daughter to wake up yelling for someone to turn it back on just when she was about to fall asleep.<br /><br />A week after we started using it the belt system started to squeak. A week after that the squeak had become so loud one night she came out of her room in tears asking me to turn it off.  I had to take it apart to oil the moving parts, which fixed the problem but also caused the thing to stop moving.<br /><br />Long story short, we've had it for a little over a month and I've had to completely disable the motion features and now only 2 of the 3 sets of lights work.  I would send it back and try to get a replacement, but I just don't have the heart to go through this whole process again.",X_train

However, I must say that I was disappointed by and large with what I actually got considering the price that I paid.  The products themselves are great but I don't notice a big difference at all from the items available at my local asian grocery store.  I purchased the same grade of items as well as all the ingredients necessary to make sushi that were not included (such as rice, vegetables, seafood, etc) for less money than it cost for just this kit.  I would not recomment purchasing it - instead, do your homework and find a local asian grocery store - the quality is the same but the price is much more palatable!",X_train
1803,"We bought this for our first child to use when our second child needs our convertible car seat.  The older one is 19 months old and about 35 inches tall.  He already needs the harness straps to be in the highest position available.  For this reason, I'm a little concerned that he'll have to go to the belt-positioning mode before we're really ready to have him out of the five-point harness.  (Straps are to be at or above child's shoulders.)    This is what the instruction manual says:    5-point harness:  22-40 lbs, 34-43 in, and over 1 year old  Belt-positioning booster:  40-80 lbs, 43-52 in, and over 1 year old    Regarding installation:  the other two car seats I have are a BabyTrend FlexLoc infant carrier and a Britax Boulevard convertible car seat.  Once we figured out how to put the harness straps through the correct slot (has to be done through the back), this seat installed as easily as either of the other two.  The model we got has a buckle for adjusting the anchor tether, and does not appear to have the \\""threading\\"" problem mentioned by previous reviewers.  My child was comfortable and didn't seem to mind being in a different seat.",X_train

1805,"I have been using this monitor multiple times a day for 2.5 weeks now, and am very pleased with it.  The 900ft range is excellent - easily reaches from baby's room on the 3rd floor all throughout our condo, as well as the driveway outside.  The display is very crisp and clear, both during the day, and after dark with the night vision.  The pan/tilt/zoom is very handy to keep an eye on the little guy as he squirms in his crib.  We have not experienced any issues with interference with our wireless networks.  I also like the ability to pair a second camera to the receiver when we have a second child.  Monitor battery life is as-claimed and can be extended by turning the video screen off and just using the audio - however neither mode lasts through the night on battery life so you have to plug the monitor in regardless.<br /><br />This is the first baby monitor I've used so cannot compare between models, but I did extensive research before purchasing and this monitor (so far) does NOT have any of the major complaints of other monitors (going &#34;out of range&#34; and unable to fix; interference with home wireless networks; extremely short battery life).<br /><br />The only thing I would change is the melody that the monitor plays when you turn it on - it is pretty loud, and from what I can tell, unable to be turned off/turned down.  Not a deal-breaker - just make sure you turn it on outside of baby's earshot. However that would be the first thing I'd change when the next model is developed.<br /><br />Overall this is a great monitor and I'd purchase it again.",X_train

1808,"I had tried this Wheat Grass Powder and liked it very much, but the price being high switched to another sold here on Amazon. Sadly, while it was much cheaper it also didn't smell like grass (which this does, a good sign) and was much lighter in color which I found off-putting.  This brand of wheat grass powder has a strong smell and a very good dark green color.  You may a lot but you get what you pay for.  I have been mixing it into green smoothies and it sure does seem to help with energy, etc.  The scoop is small so even though you pay $$ you don't use much in each server.<br /><br />Oh yes, please ignore any reviewer who complaint because this power is fine and can make a mess if not handled carefully. Wheat grass power, by nature is VERY fine and you have to handle it carefully (perhaps ads to glass while it's in a sink).  That is not the fault of the product.. it's how the product is.",X_train

1810,"I ordered both the Bumkins liners and the Bummis Bio-Soft in order to compare the two and see which I preferred.<br /><br />The differences I noticed most about the Bumkins were:<br />Larger (can actually split each sheet into 2 if you have the patience to do that, making the box last twice as long)<br />Noticeably softer<br />Pop-up style, like a tissue box, seems easier for one-handed use than the Bummis tear-off sheets. In practice, however, I found that it made little difference, because I still needed 2 hands to get the liner properly folded and positioned on the diaper!  For this reason, I generally find it easiest to get the liner out and position it in the new diaper before I take the old diaper off of the baby.<br /><br />Bummis pros:<br />Smaller footprint on the changing space (a consideration for us because we have limited space there)<br />Also large enough to possibly split into 2 liners per sheet for a smaller baby, but not for a larger one<br /><br />Both brands seem to flush equally well, and both do an excellent job of staying in place.  I cloth diapered without liners for my previous baby and with this baby until he started solids, but I definitely prefer the ease the flushable liners add and wouldn't go back to not using them at this point unless we had a septic system that couldn't handle the flushable liners.  I do recommend letting the soiled liners sit in the toilet for a couple of minutes or more before flushing -- it supposedly helps them break down more easily and reduce the likelihood of clogging the toilet, though in practice I've never had either brand's usage result in a toilet clog.<br /><br />All in all, I do slightly prefer the softer feel of the Bumkins, but the differences are minor, and I like the smaller footprint for the Bummis.  For personal preference the Bumkins win out by a hair, but both brands are similar enough that I wouldn't hesitate to buy either.",X_train

1820,"I originally gave this tub 4 stars, but the more I use it, the more I hate it. It is ridiculously too shallow. As a newborn, it was pretty shallow but okay. Now, my baby is 2 months old and has already outgrown this ridiculous tub.<br />(1) The insert is terrible. It gets stuck. The base to it is metal and is already starting to rust in places where the paint is rubbed off. It is difficult to unfold and will collapse (with baby in it!) if it isn't exactly right, which isn't easy to do. Bathing a baby, you typically don't have a lot of free hands for setting junk up. You'll need both hands to set up the sling.<br />(2) It is so shallow. Ridiculously shallow. The water goes cold by the time you get the sling set up and then get the baby undressed and ready for a bath. Then the baby is laying there getting cold because he isn't at all submerged in the shallow tub. You have to set it in the bottom of your tub and fill it to overflowing to even make it workable.<br />(3) The insert doesn't dry well, even when you hang it with the velcro loop. It just stays kind of mildly damp and cold. It has to hang a long time before it is dry.<br /><br />Save yourself the frustration and just buy something else.",X_train
1821,"I love PB2 and Chocolate PB2 and have been happily purchasing them for over a year.  The 16oz packs are a great deal- sometimes the tiny little jars retail at $5 each.  Don't be intimidated by the picture which makes it look like you're preparing for a peanut butter apocalypse- these really aren't that big, and they're very tightly packed.  I usually just put mine in a kitchen storage container for easy access and it works out just fine.<br /><br />The flavor is delicious, and I add it to a ton of stuff for that wonderful hint of peanut butter without the excessive amounts of fat.  Some things it works great on/in include:<br />smoothies, asian cuisine, sprinkled on top of ice cream (arctic zero yo!), sprinkled on an english muffin that has been spread with laughing cow cheese...omg... and lots of other things.<br /><br />However, I do not recommend the weird, mix with water thing.  I mean, why waste perfectly good PB2 concentrated powder on some bland un-spreadable mess.  You have to remember that PB2 is defatted peanuts that have been ground to a flour consistency.  Mixing water into it is literally replacing what used to be oil with water... and what do we all know? oil and water don't mix... and thus while,  naturally occurring oil + peanuts = delicious, water + PB2 = the most unexciting (not) peanut butter the derivative of which is wasted PB2.<br /><br />Also, if purchasing this for the lower calories, please take a moment to consider just how much you love this stuff.  The serving size of 2T dry is about 45cal and I'm sure more than enough peanut butter flavor for many enviable individuals.  That being said, it is VERY EASY to end up sprinkling copious amount of this stuff all over everything, and before you know it you're right up there with regular PB minus many of the health benefits and brain satiety that come with consuming the regular stuff.  Peanut butter fanatics beware :) this stuff could be your demise.",X_train

Definitely check the fit, if the straps are too tight it might not close properly making it possible for the child to open, too lose and the loops can be pulled over door knobs or if used on a cabinet the doors can be open enough that a slim arm can reach in.

And I came back to this webpage and realized it didnt' have a description that the legs open up to be used on a toilet seats also, which is a feature that's only on potette 'plus'... which I also realized after reading some of the negative reviews on this page which I missed when I was purchasing it. Wish the product page had some sort of warning or clearly written statement to notify customers how this is different from potette plus..  Since this one skids and only serves 1 function, I'm amazed to see so many positive reviews but perhaps they were from the customers who bought this item before the potette plus came out. As the other customer with negative review mentioned, I don't know why the company even makes this version anymore.. which just creates an extra hassle for them as well as customers returning the item unhappy due to wasted time and having to order the 'plus' one again..

1836,"I love key lime pies very tart and tangy, but I haven't been happy with my lime desserts since I ran out of this company's product. Using just the zest of fresh limes doesn't have enough zing for my taste buds. I would use the zest AND the oil together. And if you hate the chore of zesting a lime, you can easily say goodbye to that job and just use the oil. I can't remember exactly how much I used per pie--doesn't seem like it took too much to satisfy me, but then I would also use the zest in my food. Recommended amounts are listed on this site and I'm sure on the bottle or box of the lime oil. Though I think you will have to expertment a bit with how much you want to use in your cooking.<br /><br />I just discovered that Amazon sells my beloved natural LIME oil by itself in a 5oz. bottle! When I tried this product previously from a speciality food catalog the package contained three 3 oz. bottles of lemon, orange, and lime. While the lemon and orange oils are very fine products themselves, I didn't need nearly as much of those two oils. But if you are interested in trying all three flavors, I've noticed Amazon sells that combo too, along with individual 5 oz. bottles of orange and lemon. As for me I'm a lime freak and will be ordering the 5 oz. bottle of lime oil ASAP. I'm thinking margeritas at the moment. Oh, the possibilities!<br /><br />As an after thought, I'll probably order the 3oz. combo, too, for those times when I DO feel like making a tartier lemon bar or an orange flavored butter cream frosting.

It made her laugh, the chocolate was good quality, it was a funny conversation piece for a while before she ate it, and I got a very happy voicemail from her, overall 10 out of 10.",X_train
1855,Awesome price! We are so excited to give this to our little girl for Christmas! It's so cute and seems sturdy so I won't worry as much about her falling out of it.,X_train
1856,"We thoroughly enjoyed these truffle eggs.  They were delicious.  We even put one on my brother's Easter plate and told him it was a hard boiled egg decorated especially for him and since the shell is real, he thought the egg was also real.  The look on his face when he broke it open and found a chocolate egg was priceless!  I will buy them again.",X_train
1857,We bought two of these to replace an older set of seats we had for our new daughter. Best purchase we've made!,X_train
1858,Very easy and delicious!just add chicken and water. One package last for months.way better than the restaurant. I love it.,X_train
1859,"Cute stickers, work exactly as described. Not reusable. Don't really have anything else to say but it wants me to type more words to submit this review.",X_train
1860,Arrived in good condition and has been thriving ever since.  Be sure you research the kind of soil that a Venus-flytrap requires.,X_train
1861,"Thought I was buying anoher brand when I picked these up at the store. They are fine for kids to drink out of - my 15 month old loves it. But, as other reviewers have said there are WAY too many parts to clean. Also, it's hard to get the straw back in place. The bottom section of straw can fall off, making it hard for the child to drink. Last, but not least, my little guy tossed one of his on to a cement patio and it cracked the cup - no longer usable. So, I'm going to try another brand to see if they are a little bit easier & more durable.",X_train

1865,"These V8 V-Fusion Refresher drinks are diluted - with water - juice combinations. The good news is there is no corn syrup or artificial ingredients. However, they do add sugar. Yikes! They are 100 calories per cup, but this one has 24g of sugar which is high. You can have 50g of added sugar a day, and 100g of total sugar so this is about 1/2 of your added sugar allowance. Nutritionists would probably want you to have less sugar. A nutritionist told me to think of sugar as poison - your body will burn the sugar before the fat.  It does provide 100% of your daily vitamin C. I pour a cup of seltzer and then pour of splash of this refresher in (about 1/4 cup or 25 calories) with ice and it's a refreshing drink and deserves its name. This flavor of tangerine and passion fruit is tasty, too. I won't be buying this again because of the added sugar. I'd rather buy regular V8 Fusion juice, without added sugar, and dilute it with seltzer.  Ingredients  Water, Reconstituted Vegetable Juice Blend (Water and Concentrated Juices of Sweet Potatoes, Carrots, Reconstituted Fruit Juice Blend [Water and Concentrated Juices of Apples, Tangerines, Passion Fruit]), Sugar, contains less than 2 percent Citric Acid (for flavor), Natural Flavoring Passion Fruit Concentrate, Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid).",X_train

1869,"I originally bought this at a grocery store as part of a project to find a green tea that my husband would drink.  He's got a health condition that demands he give up coffee, and the only tea \\""allowed\\"" is Green Tea (due to the reported health benefits).<br /><br />We tried many brands and many varieties and this one has a good flavor...kinda citrus-y and not watery or bitter.  The pleasant aroma hits you when you open the package. That's another benefit, the tea bags come individually packaged so they stay fresh and also travel well, if need be.  The tea bags come with nice little sayings printed on them, too.<br /><br />I ordered these through Amazon because the product has become hard to find in local stores, and the bulk price is fair.  It is cheaper still if you subscribe.",X_train
1870,Shipped promptly and was well packed. It is not the same as the one sourced from the UK (tin with a chocolate swirl on it). Flavor good but not as full and powder seems a little waxy.,X_train
1871,"All the flavors are delicious. Thick, smooth and gourmet!  I use the fig and the raspberry straight out of the bottles as a salad dressing. I don't even add oil, so it has very few calories.",X_train
1872,"It does exactly what it says on the packaging. What's most fun is having friends/family try it for the first time. Watching the wonder and bewilderment on their face is like magic. Be mindful of mealtime, though, as you wouldn't want a delicious meal &#34;ruined&#34; by everything being overly sweet to the tongue.",X_train
1873,I've been adding these to my morning protein shakes. Really no taste from the Chia Seeds but I know they are good for me. Great price and received it as always in two days...Thanks Amazon and thank you Viva Labs for producing a really good product.,X_train
1874,This Product didn't work for me (Miyoahi brand only).  Gave me a headache.  Don't let the Japanese name confuse you.  When I tried to return it I was given an address in China!  So I threw it away.  Red Leaf brand is much better.,X_train
1875,I'm very happy with this baby food blender. It is super easy to use and to clean. I was hesitating with complete sets that cost much more and I'm happy I didn't get one. You don't need anything more than that to make baby food.,X_train
1876,I didn't realize this was for 8+ little disappointed in that but it shows in the pictures that is still works for car-seats! It is super cute my child loved it the second they saw it! It seems to take FOREVER to be delivered! I gave this a 4 star because it is cute and was worth the wait; but shipping was horrid! Expect it to arrive 9-12 days after order was placed!,X_train
1877,I love this flavor! It taste great! It was just as described and very well packaged. It even arrived earlier than expected :),X_train
1878,"Very good quality, helps the skin breathes so well. My daughter uses it every night and it keeps her comfortable.",X_train

1882,"I agree with everyone that says this toy is 1)over priced 2)not age appropriate (for younger child) 3) only one light responds to that one lil button 4)volume is so low can not be turned up!! My son just turned 1 and i wanted to give him a toy similar to our android phones. There are so many wrong things with this toy phone and it took FOREVER to arrive. I almost forgot i ordered it when it came. My son luckily always fines one button on toys and presses it repeatedly so this one and only button was it LOL. I was really mad that it cost so much. I would pay $5 dollars maybe for this, $10 aint worth it neither. He got a great time warner cable like remote for $10 at conway store that does WAY more then this silly phone. Its so huge too, i guess for smaller hands. I do not like it but what can i do now its here and its part of the collection of other over priced toys that do very little. I'm done buying toys for a while. Rather see them all in person and make decision then. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!",X_train

1891,"I cannot begin to express how disappointing this product is. The suction cups never stay attached for more than a few hours. My son can easily lift the lid and dislodge the lock. The whole idea of this thing is to keep him OUT of the toilet, not make it more fun to play with. Aaaarrrrggghhhh!! The only thing it does is make me so FRUSTRATED! What a waste of money.",X_train
1892,"I am still experimenting with the best mix for me, but so far, the milk is too overwhelming for a person in me that likes his chocolate/cereal/etc. with his milk rather than the other way around.  In other words, I'm tasting too much of the milk and it's not a taste I care for.  It is better than the cheap stuff like store brand or Swiss, etc. but I would much rather use it in my espresso machine than boil off milk (will be one of my next experiments).      Pros:    -Very good chocolate.  I have used the straight cooking based Ghiradelli cocoa and it is intense, but good actually in an espresso type situation.  I'm thinking this stuff should be a bit less intense than the cocoa made for cooking and be even better for my personal purpose with it.    -Beats the store brand or use with water stuff if you either have the mix down or do not mind the extra milky taste.    -Even though milk has to be used and milk does cost more than free water, the chocolate is not only worth it but cost to cost, the intensity level of Ghiradelli vs. Swiss or other is a lot higher.  In other words, while Swiss may be cheaper on paper, it will take a TON more to get to the same intensity level as Ghiradelli AND it will not taste as good.  So the having to buy milk is really the only additional cost factor going on here.      Cons:    -I have yet to figure out a good enough potion that makes the taste less milky.  If I cannot figure one out, I will have to downgrade this review for the product being of use for only specific people or applications.    -Have to buy milk and with such a nice chocolate, I'd recommend an organic or nice albeit expensive milk.  I will update this review if I find that using water/espresso machine/etc. factors can take the a good bit of milk out of the equation.      So there you have it.  More pros than cons from me, though I am only partially satisfied at this point.  Will update if I can figure out how to nail down better solutions to my liking, and if anything, I can always use it how I did with the Ghiradelli type made for cooking!  Afterall, I bought this hoping it would make good hot cocoa, but knowing it would be top quality chocolate that I could at least toss into my espresso mixes if it didn't work out.",X_train
1893,"We are never purchasing our tea from a brick and mortar store again. In our house there is a lot of tea drank and it can get expensive. However, purchasing this helped with that- we have to buy tea a lot less often (I think this amount of tea will last us quite a long time!) and we spent a lot less purchasing this from Amazon than we would have if we bought the same amount at the store.<br /><br />Overall- we are quite pleased with this purchase.",X_train

We have a 2-ply Boa from Koala Baby and he falls right to sleep every time he's wrapped in it. Babies are messy so I wanted to get another Boa just in case. I sorted through the majority of ones available on Amazon and this one was cute so I got it. Its a bit more plush than his Koala Baby Boa and does exactly what I'm confident all Boas do. I just laid him on it and he fell right to sleep, woke up 2 hours later nice and calm just staring at the ears.    Perfect as a barrier from the cold, or chilly weather. Its soft on baby's skin and doubles as a buddy for outings. This blanket will last a long time. Well worth the buy.",X_train
1900,"Graduating from the bag-style fleece sleep sack to the thinner, footed mesh sack was a big deal for my little one. It was great for warmer weather and more motility as she got bigger. We both love this! It's an extra layer of comfort and warmth with added mobility for toddlers on the go. I hate hate hate the princess but I find that often pinky, girly products are cheaper than the unisex or &#34;boy&#34; options.",X_train
1901,"My mom bought this for my 2 month old son, and he loves it! There's so much color, and fun for him, he gets excited everytime he sees it. It plays Mozart (which is very stimulating for the brain), and the animals and textures are very interesting for babies. I would recommend for all babies to have one!",X_train

1903,It was a real bargain and it came in a pack of 2 bags . The discount made it even a better deal.,X_train
1904,The taste is good.  It isn't particularly spicy.  Oregon Chai makes a spicy version that I may try next.  Chai tea latte is typically a hot beverage.  I like this one even with cold milk.  It still has the same Chai flavor and is really quick and easy.<br /><br />The pump is sold separately.  You don't have to buy the pump.  You can measure the amount of concentrate to use in several different ways.  The pump is very convenient to measure out the concentrate directly into a glass or mug.,X_train
1905,Not enough Cola taste.  You have to use a lot of drops to get the cola-ish flavor.  the results leave too much stevia taste in your mouth.,X_train

1907,"This coffee is not a true medium roast like Caribou French Roast, Donut House, etc. there was not much coffee flavor at all.

Wish I didn't have 45 more cups to go thru!",X_train
1908,"I am satisfied with the product for its spicy delicious taste that reminds me of the delicious foods of Korea I tasted in Korea and its side-dish, the Kimchee.

On ordering the product the delivery is always on time and quick and the packaging excellent.",X_train

1910,I was very disappointed when South Beach discontinued the Cereal bars a few years ago and was told it was for re-packaging. I was very excited to see what I thought was its replacement. I ordered them full of enthusiasm only to be disappointed by the product. It not only is smaller than the old version but dry and stail. Unfortunately I was only able to order 8 boxes of 5 and now feel stuck with them.<br /><br />Lesson Learned!!,X_train
1911,I love this monitor. With my last child I used a summer monitor. This one cost less and is just as good. The only thing I like more on the summer is the lights would indicate the level of &#34;noise&#34; in the room. So if I were drying my hair and couldn't hear the monitor I would have the lights to get my attention. That being said I believe the picture on the infant optics monitor is superior. Infant optics customer service has also proven to be FANTASTIC!,X_train
1912,"Everything was great except that the liquid can be easily squeezed out of the nozzle by a toddler, resulting in quite a bit of mess.  I bought it to see if there was an easier to bring soups on the go, but I think I will revert back to the original bowl and spoon technique.",X_train
1913,My 5 year old daughter loves it. She feels like such a big girl. I was tempted to get the version of this with the latch system because I was concerned it would shift around my back seat while my daughter wasn't in it. It doesn't seem to budge. So Im glad I saved my self $20 dollars.,X_train
1914,it is good for the price .. would have been great it has wheels and a place to keep the tray if you dont use it but these models were more expensive so it  does the job and easy to put together and not very expensive,X_train

1916,"I'm a connoisseur of dark chocolate. Lindt, Hershey, Dove, Godiva, all of them. But while this bar is a bit milder in flavor than most it still has a smooth rich flavor that treats the tongue to a luxurious bath of chocolate flavor.<br /><br />It's one of those few foods that I find myself inhaling whenever I eat it, no matter how many times I've tried it or how recently I've eaten before. Before you buy a case, try one at your local Whole Foods, but be prepared to find yourself addicted.",X_train

1918,"I purchased this because my wife told me to (after all, she does wear the pants in our family). She is happy with it, and when she's happy, I'm happy. Holds the kid's various items (toys, sippy cups, etc) well and can be removed quickly in the need of cleaning or placing the rear seats down. Price point is great considering one at a retail store is about 10% higher (not to mention sales tax of 7%).",X_train
1919,Beware of this product!! We tried to use this product at 7 weeks old as we were transitioning from his bassinet to the crib and we found him 2 nights in a row able to slide down from the incline and his head was pass the side positioners! The third night we used the side positioners only as they can velcro to sheet saver we have attached in the crib and it worked better. This is a overpriced product and the incline padding is very dangerous for a baby.,X_train

1931,"This is some classy stuff. The tin it came in was pink, very pretty and reusable, so I'll definitely be keeping it once I've finished my tea. What I like about this is that a little goes a long way. The leaves open up when wet so there's more in it than you think there is. The smell is pleasant and very flowery. There are multiple, specific seeping instructions on the tin for various quantities. There's also no need to let it sit long. The flavor comes out immediately.

I find that it takes the perfect adjustment to camouflage them, but honestly, I don't care. They are comfortable and washable. Plus, you can dry them in the dryer as opposed to so many other brands that require air drying.<br /><br />But my favorite thing about these pads (why I give them 5 out of 5 stars) is that they do not visibly leak. Let me explain. There have been times when I saturated these pads and I could feel that my shirt and bra were damp but no matter how saturated, there was no visual evidence that I had \\""leaked.\\"" No embarrassing wet spots on my shirt, right where my nipples are, no dripping or streaking. No one can tell if I am \\""leaking,\\"" which, in my opinion, would be much more embarrassing than someone possibly noticing that I am wearing breast pads.",X_train

Having a heart that creates in life-giving ways also creates miracles that don't always get noticed, but to those who pray and believe, we will notice as we focus on those good results. This was the first time I've used Coconut Flour, and honestly, it was not one of my favorites. I do enjoy the taste of coconut, so I was hoping it had a noticeable taste of it, but it didn't. This flour is fine (not course) in texture, and it is light and crumbly in baking. I did not read the back of the pkg, so I did not follow the guidelines on replacing regular flour with &#34;only&#34; 1/4-1/2 cup in recipes that call for more than a cup of flour. I made organic chocolate chip cookies and replaced all the regular flour with this coconut flour and what a crumbly mess I made!! and it didn't taste like our original chocolate chip cookies using all coconut flour. This is a flour that leaves a batter dry and crumbly when you replace all or most regular flour with it. Next time I will only use 1/4-1/2 cup in a recipe calling for 1 1/4-2 cups flour. Needless to say, the cookie dough was crumbly (using all coconut flour) and found out then I had messed up big time!! but for the heck of it, I put the whole crumbly cookie dough mess in one big glass dish to see how it would bake lol. I included a pic of my organic chocolate chip crumbly cookie dough disaster masterpiece. Living and learning! me and my family took a small portion of the crumbly baked mess and the rest is history! (though I will dissect and eat most of the chocolate chips and macadamia nuts). I had doubled the recipe, so what a waste I made with a good flour! I still prefer part oat flour for my cookies because I like the oat texture and taste (which is also crumbly if used too much) in cookies. For me, this flour is good in muffins, cakesand other moist breads, but only use a 1/4th for each cup of flour!",X_train
1949,"Overall, my wife and I are satisfied with the fit and finish of the Delta Bentley crib. With only one exception, each piece was machined and painted well, and fit together with adequate precision. The single issue we encountered concerning assembly of the crib was the discovery that two holes meant to line up for a retaining pin were somewhat offset. Ultimately, this did not prevent assembly; we merely had to apply more torque to the adjacent connecting screws in order to pull the two parts together. Once assembled, the crib seems to be rather sturdy, and we expect it to hold up well. I was particularly impressed by the construction of the matress support. I expected it to be a slab of MDF board held up with run-of-the-mill shelf pegs. To my pleasant surprise, its actually an all-metal design, incorporating a tubular frame with a spring-connected center wire grid. So in form and function, it seems to be great. Further, it looks good, too, from a distance. And this leads me to my one major gripe concerning this crib which is this: Delta's manufacturer's stock photographs of the crib are tantamount to false advertising! Take a good look at the official product photos for this crib. Do you see any exposed screw heads or fasteners? Neither did we, and seemingly having no visible screws was the main reason we chose this crib by Delta over several other manufacturer's offerings. However, as I began to assemble this crib, it became apparent very quickly that this crib does indeed have screws that are visible from multiple viewing angles, even the same angles as pictured in Delta's official product photos. So, obviously there's some photo manipulation going on. That's just a shameful tactic. Come on Delta; be up-front with your customers!",X_train

The wipes also stay warm for a bit, so you don't have to rush to use them before they get cold.  Has a bit of condensation inside, so if you aren't using daily, it will leave a brown mark on the wipes.

For the longest time, Amazon was the supplier and it was about $16 with free shipping for Prime members (less than $1.40 a can, which beats the $1.99 that it costs at most retail stores, I've seen it go as high as $2.79). I've seen Amazon go as high as $2 a can, and then you have those crazy offers with insane shipping costs that triple the price of the tea.<br /><br />Cost aside, this tea is the best going, and I have been a sweet tea drinker for over 20 years, across the north and south United States! Not only is this tea refreshing, but you can drink a few cans a day without the sugar and carbohydrate content!! Best. Tea.

Unfortunately, although I love the tea, I will not order if it becomes more expensive than $1.40 a can, including shipping. There are other suppliers like Wal-Mart who can offer it cheaper and also offer free shipping, so if Amazon wants to keep moving on this product that seems to be selling very well, they'll try to keep the price down.<br /><br />Please keep the price down!

I have yet to wash it but hope it should wash fine.  However, I am not too thrilled about the internal polyester batting:  it's very thick, bulky, and not quilted at all.  I fear that after I wash the cotton cover, re-inserting the thick, fluffy, un-quilted and definitely not-slippery batting back inside the cover would be one hell of a task and might release lots of dust from the batting... I would have preferred something like a dense, durable woolen blanket inside.  I think that I might just buy such a blanket, cut it to size, and replace the internal batting with it.... I find that the $129 or so I paid for the pad is too much considering the polyester inside... But I wanted a pad with removable and washable cover, so, in that respect this fit the bill.",X_train

2030,"This juice is the real thing. It's beyond me to understand why the \\""fake\\"" kind of cranberry juice is so popular. By fake, I don't mean where they add other juice besides cranberry (that's fine), I mean the kind with sugar or fructose or \\""corn syrup\\"" in it, which is the kind that is most readily available, and the kind that you generally get when you order \\""cranberry juice\\"" in a restaurant or bar. Northland was one of the pioneers in marketing the \\""real\\"" stuff -- 100% juice, like this item -- and we should be grateful to them. Other companies in this movement have included Apple & Eve, Knudsen, and Lakewood. The 100% stuff is tastier, healthier, and doesn't wreak havoc with your blood-sugar levels. More recently, Ocean Spray, the \\""big boy\\"" of the industry, has gotten involved, and that's good for us, because it means the 100% products are more widely available. I just wonder what took them.     There are various flavors -- cranberry grape, cranberry raspberry, cranberry blueberry, cranberry apple, and plain cranberry among others -- take your pick. (The hardest to find is cranberry BLACKBERRY, and it's well worth finding.) Some of the companies have a flavor called \\""Just Cranberry\\"" or \\""Pure Cranberry\\"" or some such. BEWARE OF THAT! Not that it's \\""bad,\\"" but it's different from the versions that are called simply \\""cranberry,\\"" which actually have other juices mixed in  -- this can be very confusing. The \\""pure\\"" cranberry isn't really drinkable in that form. I once got a slightly rude surprise when I tried it. I figured pure cranberry would be the best of all, but it's too tart for most people to drink straight-up. It's probably good for mixing, though, if you want to give that a try.    Most if not all of the commercially-available 100% juice cranberry products are very good, but Northland has been my slight favorite. I know that the company used to provide the similar products for some supermarket-chain labels, and possibly they still do -- and those store brands are usually much less expensive than the Northland. My local supermarket is Stop & Shop, and their 100% juice products are excellent; I suspect they are indeed provided by Northland. Whenever I find the flavor I want in the Stop & Shop label, that's what I buy. Otherwise, I'm thrilled to find Northland.     In recent years the Northland company had some corporate troubles, which I doubt had anything to do with the products, since they've always been terrific. I thought that one silly little thing that might have held the company back was the very poor text-graphics on the products' labels, and in my original version of this review I talked about this. The text was inaptly written and the lines of text were divided clumsily, with the result that the nature of the product wasn't communicated well. Obviously this wasn't a reason not to buy the products, but I'd bet it did hurt the sales. Well, would you believe, as of March '06, THEY'VE FIXED IT!! I don't know if these Amazon.com reviews might actually have helped alert the company to the problem, but whatever made them do it, BRAVO! The labels are now as great as the product.",X_train

2042,"****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn't seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive [[ASIN:B001BM6LVS Earth's Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)]].<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at [[ASIN:B001BM395E Earth's Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)]], (and so I posted my review there as well).  I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />****UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least.whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something.

2068,"A friend gave us this potty when our girl was starting to become independent.  She was fine using this but preferred the more traditional training \\""chair\\"".  Now that our boy is becoming more independent, we've rediscovered this potty and just love it!  We've just bought a second one to have one upstairs and one downstairs.      After having gone through this with two kids now, I like that it's one piece - our boy was taking the \\""bowl\\"" out of the other kind that we'd used with our girl and putting it on his head.  You can well imagine how charming that is. It's also completely smooth - no bumps or ridges or crannies for anything to get into and fester.  With this one, I lift our toilet lid and seat and then just dump it quickly in. (Imagine the same motion as pouring from a full water glass at a restaurant into your kiddo's sippy.)  I've never made a mess EXCEPT will often have pee still on the seat of the potty where it pours out.  (I say this bc a lot of the reviewers complain that it's hard to dump but I just haven't had that problem, or more accurately, I see what they're talking about but it's just not that big of a problem.) I just have a roll of paper towels and a box of wipes by the regular toilet to take care of any mess, as you almost have to always wipe out the bowl of it anyway.  I think all training pottys have a similar problem when you dump it.  This one is easy for him to lift and move around and super comfortable to sit on and he pees INTO it and not on it.  The other one that we had (that has since been relegated to the closet), he would pee all over when he was sitting there.  YUCK.  This one is so much more comfortable for him - he sits with a book or a puzzle and is totally fine to \\""wait it out\\"".  The other chair kind cramped his \\""style\\"" if you know what I mean.    I'd certainly try this for a girl, but it's a no-brainer for my boy!",X_train

2080,"The product name led me to believe that the total package is of 160-count, split in two packs of 80-count each. However, there are two boxes of 160-count each.<br /><br />These shipped from Amazon quick, via subscribe and save. When I first signed up, the estimate delivery date was a week later. However, these were shipped the same night, and arrived the next day, 5 days earlier than the estimate. So definitely don't worry about the shipping speed.<br /><br />These are very fresh, unlike some of the old shelf Jolly Ranchers that are kind of melted into the wrapper, and you can't take the wrapping off without your fingers getting all sticky. There is definitely a difference in the freshness,  and it's a good thing.<br /><br />Flavor wise, this is my favorite flavor, and if they came in a mixed-flavor pack I'd pick these out right away. However, having only watermelon, all the time, without having to pick them out, got really old really quick, and kind of ruined the flavor for me. Maybe it's because I ate like 20 of them the first day they arrived. lol.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like the watermelon flavor, definitely get this.

I originally wanted a Chicco Caddy stroller cause it costs less but I'm glad we went with this one.  I'm 5'10\\"" and my husband is about 6 feet tall and this stroller is very comfortable to push.  It may actually be one of the few strollers that is harder to push for a shorter person.  It feels sturdy and well made.  Even when the baby wasn't in it and the diaper bag was hanging off the handles it stayed upright.  The stroller back also reclines fairly easily but you have to be careful when putting it back up if the baby is sitting in cause their arm can get pinched.  Thankfully we noticed before he got pinched.  It is light and folds in such a way that the wheels don't leave the ground which is a lot easier than most umbrella strollers. (Picture the Graco gravity fold of the Quattro Tour which we also have).  We've gotten to the point where we use this stroller more than the Quattro.

2091,"When baby hit 3 months she turned into a drool machine. Most of the bibs I had were those little cheapos that are made of some thin synthetic fabric that soaks through right away. I searched amazon for the best bibs for droolers and picked a few with decent reviews to try:<br /><br />aden + anais 3 Pack Nibble Snap Bibs<br />Imse Vimse Organic Cotton Terry Dribble Bibs<br />Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature Milk Feeding Bib<br /><br />Baby is now 7 months and the drooling is gone, so we're not using bibs much at the moment. When I was using them, I liked the aden and anais best.<br /><br />The Imse Vimse are very small which would have been fine for my purpose and they had the nicest colors to me- fairly neutral so they went with most outfits. They also fit nice and snug around the neck due to the tie. The bib cotton was thick and absorbent, but I rarely used them because the edging is made with some terrible rough fabric. If it's cotton, they must be breeding a new special type with the texture of... gosh, I'm trying to think of a fabric with such a terrible texture, but I don't know what it would be. Suffice it to say that it doesn't belong in the sensitive neck rolls of a little baby. So, these got very little use.<br /><br />The Tommy Tippy are nice and probably well suited to keeping milk out of the neck rolls, but the bib itself is a thin synthetic material and not all that absorbent. So, they soak through too quickly to be of much use for a serious drooling problem. The bib size is perfect, not tiny like the Imse Vimse and not huge like Aden and Anais. I don't love the velcro- you have to be careful that it doesn't snag other things in the wash and if you don't line it up perfectly it can irritate baby's skin. The snaps on Aden and Anais are better.<br /><br />Finally, my favorite ended up being the Aden and Anais which are designed for eating, not drooling. They are huge, more of a smock on a 3 month old, but this is perfect for an eating bib. At three months baby wasn't mobile yet, so being too large was no biggie- if I need to resume use, it may interfere with her crawling as they hang past the waist. They were also a big big around the neck for little one but we didn't seem to have a big problem with the drool running into her neck so this worked out ok. The reason I loved them is that they are so soft and so absorbent, they never soaked through with the drool and I could take the long bib and wipe her face with it. The Imse Vimse were too small for this and the Tommy Tippy not absorbent enough. Another possible advantage is the rather loud pattern does not show stains as much as the plainer bibs. I do wish they came in more color options, I don't love either choice, but on the whole I am happy and I know these will last forever, like the Aden and Anais blankets, they just get better with washing.",X_train

If I push monkey up more on his chest it helps a little. I just wish you can take it off monkey to wash It right. I just used a baby wipe to wipe down monkey. The passy I just wash in sink but monkey gets all wet. This item def not going out in public cause id wash the monkey everyday lol. Im wondering if its safe to throw in dish washer when needed?,X_train

2114,"We had had our Bumbleride Indie for a few months now and am so far very impressed. I live very close to the beach, so wanted to get a stroller that I could take easily on the sand, and other similar terrain. After doing extensive research I decided to go with the Bumbleride Indie and am very happy I did!! For an all terrain, jogging stroller, the Indie is actually quiet light and SOOOO easy to maneuver. I can easily push the pram with one hand even with my toddler weighing almost 34 pounds in the seat. He loves riding in it and insists every time I say we are going for a walk that we take the stroller..lol...he jumps right in and doesn't budge. We recently went for a stroll along the beach and it handled very nicely on the compact sand nearer the water. The air filled tires are great and the suspension superb. The canopy is huge and offers more than substantial coverage from the elements. The adjustable handle is very nice and very comfortable. My 3 year old loves being able to move the handle down so he can push his brother. The foot break is very easy to put on and off and the stroller folds down very nicely. I can get it easily in and out of our Honda Odyssey and removing the back wheels makes it even more compact. Weighing only 20 pounds is awesome for such a full range stroller.<br /><br />The ONLY complaint i have is the recline feature. The strap can get very sticky and makes it a pain sometimes to lower the seat back. I do however love how with adjustable foot rest and full recline of the seat, the stroller basically offers a bassinet environment without having to purchase additional items. I still give the stroller 5 stars though as all the other great feature outweigh this one downfall. It is definitely  worth the price and the new changes that were made in the 2013 make it even better!!!",X_train
2115,"My wife & I got this seat for our 1 year old, 20 lbs. son.  He's a little over 30\\"".  He fits in the seat great.  The seat fits in the car (2007 Honda Pilot) extremely well.  It's not too big or bulky like some people have complained about.  He has a lot more room in this seat than in his infant seat.  It was easy to adjust to both fit our son and fit in the car.  It was very easy to install using the LATCH system.  Literally took me 3 minutes to get into the car.  The pre-setup took a little longer, just because I wanted to make sure that I had all the straps at the right levels to fit him.  We had a Graco Snugride 35 prior to this seat, and the setup was very similar and easy to use.  It does exactly what it is supposed to.",X_train
2116,"Our baby has severe issues with lactose, to the point that he cannot tolerate even breastmilk. The pedi put him on similac sensitive, which helped a bit with the eczema, vomiting and diarrhea, but it upset his stomach, caused gas and constipation. The pedi switched him to alimentum after the similac sensitive because of mucous in his stool. For those that have not tried alimentum, it seriously stinks and tastes even worse! Our poor baby screamed for a week on alimentum because it tore his stomach up. Not to mention everything else started coming back as well. Now enter lactorelief! We saw dramatic improvements within 24 hours! He has been on it for close to a month now and he has no stomach trouble, he poos regularly, his skin is beautiful and he is not congested all of the time. He also used to hate tummy-time (I'm assuming because his stomach hurt), but now he doesn't mind it. He sleeps better, too! And as a bonus, lactorelief tastes amazing!

2123,"I have seen plenty of mixed reviews about the Baby Trend Jogger Travel System. Many of the negative reviews claimed that this product does not hold up well over the long haul, citing its low price as evidence that it could not be a very reliable stroller after all.  While that might be true, this stroller has worked out PERFECTLY for my wife and me as a second stroller. My family has a summer home on Fire Island, which is off of the South Shore of Long Island, and is only accessible by ferry boat. My wife and I decided, although it would be more expensive, that we would need a second set of many items for our baby boy because we did not want to have to lug too many things back and forth each week; that meant a second crib, play pen, bather, jungle gym, and so on and so forth, but also a second stroller.  We bought the Peg Perego Pliko as our primary stroller, with a matching car seat, that fit into the stroller for when he was an infant. The Peg combined with the car seat ran close to $700! With that kind of investment, we did not want to drag the stroller and car seat out to the beach each weekend, where they could get ruined by the elements and we figured that the stroller might not handle so well on the boardwalks and sandy terrain. We thought that a jogger would be the ideal type of stroller for Fire Island: Light weight, durable, compact, great for an active lifestyle. At first we were set on getting a Baby Jogger, with the \\""City Mini\\"" being the least expensive and most logical choice. However, knowing that our boy would still be younger than six months all summer long, we knew we needed to be able to use the car seat in the stroller. That presented the problem of having to either a). use an adaptor to put our Peg Perego car seat into the jogger, which we did not want to do for reasons already discussed, or b). buy ANOTHER car seat to go along with the jogger. We reluctantly decided to try using our existing car seat with the Baby Jogger, although that meant that not only might it be harmed in transit and out at the beach, but that we would have to carry it back and forth with us. Besides, we did not want to spend a couple hundred dollars on a car seat that we would really only need for one summer. Also, the adapter that made the Baby Jogger car seat-ready did not look very safe.  Enter the Baby Trend Travel System! My wife spotted it on the floor of the stroller section at Buy Buy Baby. We could not believe that it was so inexpensive AND that it included a car seat! We liked the styling and colors, the cup holders, and little change compartment. The little area underneath the stroller for storing things was even larger than on our Peg Perego! Also, the car seat (which we found out got an extremely high safety rating on its own), snapped into the stroller portion securely and easily. The salesman at Buy Buy Baby admitted that it was a popular stroller although he did not know much about it. When we told him why we needed it: as a second stroller that we would use and leave out at the beach house, he convinced us that we would be crazy to spend $500 on anything else.  The jogger, along with a collection of other items arrived at the house on Fire Island and I frenetically started to assemble everything. I thought the stroller would be difficult (mainly because our Peg was a bit harder to assemble than I thought it should be), so I saved it for last. When I finally got around to putting the stroller together, I was amazed at the ease of assembly. The frame came fully assembled, with the canopies and seating area attached, and all I had to do was unfold the frame and snap in the wheels. Once I snapped the tray table into place, the car seat also snapped right in. The stroller is easy to fold up and to disassemble.  I have heard complaints about the jogger's handling, particularly that the front wheel wobbles. This has not been my experience and I have brought the stroller over sand, rocks, and boardwalks. The large, mountianbike style tires are ideal for such terrain. Further the stroller has done great having been accidentally left out in the rain, and being in an environment where the sea air is moist, salty, and very tough on metal and fabrics; I had expected the stroller to have shown some rust and fading by now, but that has not been the case at all.  All told, we have had the Baby Trend Jogger Travel System for about two and a half months and have gotten about 30 day's use out of it. So, I cannot vouch for its quality over a 365 day period, or as a primary stroller. Since our son is our first born, my wife and I had the original mind-set that we would spare no expense in getting the best of everything for him. So, if you are convinced that a more expensive stroller would be a safer, better quality product for everyday use, then I totally understand. However, my wife and I have quickly learned where we might want to splurge and in which areas we are better off saving money when it comes to the baby. My only complaint about the stroller is that the tires were difficult to inflate with a regular bicycle pump and I had to take them down to a local hardware store and use the high-pressure electrical pump in order to inflate the tires.  So, if you are looking for a second stroller or something that you can easily travel with, in the interest of saving wear and tear on your primary stroller, or to save yourself the aggravation of having to carry your primary stroller to and from places, and do not feel like spending too much on a second stroller, the Baby Trend is an EXCELLENT product that deserves consideration, and will probably be durable enough to be a primary stroller as well. My wife and I have been nothing but pleased.",X_train

2125,"So after spending about $150 on a huge gate that blocked off my kitchen, we moved and I bought yet another gate, then a third, all looking for a way to keep my kids safe.  The problem was, we all kept tripping on the gates and slamming our toes into the bars on each side.  We had a small step ladder, but when both boys fought to use it at the same time, it was time to finally get the learning tower.  Both boys can use it at once, and the nice thing is, between hanging on my leg, or climbing up here to watch me, guess which they choose, EVERY TIME?  Yep, the tower.  I have a small kitchen, so the real estate loss is a bit tough, but I now have a two year old that helps me make coffee, smoothies, shreds lettuce, and likes to help set the table.  The gate is gone, and all of us are so much happier.  It holds 500 pounds, so my husband even uses it to reach the high shelves.  My biggest regret is how long i waited to get this.  I should have had this on the baby registry.<br /><br />Edit:<br />*Since this is wood, I get a little nervous when the kiddos splash water on this, and used a pet mat on this as a non-skid surface when they are \\""helping\\"" to wash dishes.

Even if they are a bit overpriced for what they are it was an amazing experience to suck on a tab and then try a dozen or so familiar fruits, vinegar, condiments etc. for what felt like the first time ever.  Wow, it's like psychedelics for your taste buds! Very fun and also a great way to eat sour yet healthy fruits etc and a great way to drink lemonade without any added sugar. I hope they become more widely available and at lower prices, as this stuff might help some people (diabetics especially) get into a more healthy lifestyle without missing their sweets. We found strawberries to be the overall best taste but it was all good. The tabs we got in this shipment,  Mar 2014, were splitable / scored down the center (I read some reviews that said some were not scored in the middle) but we went ahead and ate whole tabs anyway and the effect seemed to last 2 to 3 hrs.

2160,"We introduced this toy to our 5 month old and he really likes it. His little fingers can grab the ball easily, he shakes it and throws it to hear the rattle and it has nice bright colors. It doesn't roll very far because of the little caterpillar along the outside and I'm not really sure how to feel about that! On one hand, I'm glad I'm not constantly chasing it down after he throws it but on the other, eventually he'll want to roll a ball around smoothly. It's cheap enough this isn't much of a price issue rather than a longevity issue. This will probably go in the baby toys needing to be packed away instead of something timeless.  The quality of the product is great; I've been smacked in the head with it and it doesn't hurt as much as headbutts, flailing arms or other various things babies do to abuse their parents.

2163,"My husband and I bought this in anticipation of our son's birth.  We wanted toys that hang down for him to play with but really didn't want to spend a fortune.  There are just a few points I have to make:    - The mat is very skinny. HOWEVER, we solved that by simply taking the mat off the arches and placing it on a blanket.  This caused the arches to stretch apart, giving our boy actually a pretty good amount of room to play, twisting, turning, and rolling. This also made the toys lower, so it's easier for my son to get them in his mouth if he works at it, which he enjoys.  (I find it quite funny to see him licking the ball on the seahorse contentedly, causing it to spin.)     - The outside edges are \\""hard\\"" plastic, I suppose, as another review stated, but my boy didn't seem to notice or care, even when he hit it.  He's four and a half months old and has only hit his head on the plastic edging with any amount of force once that I've noticed (and he plays with it a lot of the day).    - Number of toys:  Yes, it only has three toys.  However, you can remove them to wash them or turn them so they face whichever direction you want.  I have simply added another toy with plastic toy links in between the octopus and seahorse.  If I feel like adding something to the ball side, I usually add plastic toy keys or something else by clipping it around the ribbon holding the ball up so it will make more noise when he hits it.  I do wish they'd throw in another toy or two just to attach to the mat so the baby can't push them away by accident--they made the upper toys attach to the bottom if you want, but I don't want to move them because I want them to hang... the purpose of this toy.  I want toys to hang and be on the ground, so he can be entertained as he rolls between tummy and back, so I just put a few other toys on our blanket.    - The toys are also \\""hard\\"" plastic.  My boy really whacks them with all his might but has never seemed even slightly bothered.  I think the fact that they are like that is actually really good, because they're easy to wash down if you need to and they make a satisfying sound when they clack together, which our son adores.    - I know the ball is for the feet, supposedly, but I just switch which side I put his his head on.  He really loves that ball, actually, even just by itself.  He hits it with a lot of excitement, pulls it toward his mouth to try to eat it, etc.  It's nice to change up what his hands get at and what noise his feet make, I think.    - I'm glad I bought this because he is learning a lot from it.  First, he just stared at it.  Then, he accidentally hit the toys.  Then he started working on his coordination and being able to hit the toys on purpose.  Then he could single out one toy, sweep his arm and make them clack together, and use different arms.  Then he could grasp the toy, and practiced that quite a bit.  He does all the above still, and also rolls around and plays with toys I also put on the blanket.    - This has helped entertain my baby while I try to scarf down breakfast.  At the very first, it gave me only a few minutes, when he could just look at it, but as he's grown, I can now even make a warm breakfast, eat it at a leisurely pace and do dishes.  Then I go and play with him, so I'm not saying it makes you not have to play (and good thing because it's fun to!) but it does help give you a little time and baby learns he doesn't have to have you there every moment of the day.    - I will admit that other Fisher-Price mats are much cooler and bigger, but at the same time, I am really glad I bought this one.  It was affordable and has provided an amazing amount of entertainment and enjoyment through (four and half months so far) and I am sure will continue to, as we haven't even tried to change it into the tunnel or anything yet.",X_train

The other varieties don't change that.<br /><br />Second, the ingredients -<br /><br />This is the listed ingredient list.  I have a sensitivity to sugar alcohol (zylitol, splenda (sucralose), etc) so I use stevia in my coffee.  No problem.  With this drink, I started having gastrointestinal issues common to sugar alcohols.  I didn't know what was causing it so I changed some things in my diet to no avail.  Then I looked at this ingredient list.  Stevia is NOT the primary sweetener.  Ingredients are listed by the most prevalent first - erythritol is a sugar alcohol.  Um.. no thanks.  I wanted a naturally stevia sweetened drink - not another sugar alcohol one.<br /><br />I feel this company is being dishonest in its product.  I've discontinued use of this line of beverages while my system settles down from the sugar alcohol and will not be drinking them again.  The taste is inferior and artificial and the ingredients cause me to have problems.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />CARBONATED WATER, **ERYTHRITOL**, CARAMEL COLOR, TARTARIC ACID, REB A (STEVIA EXTRACT), FUMARIC ACID, CAFFEINE, LIME OIL, LEMON OIL, NATURAL FLAVORS, CASSIA OIL, NUTMEG OIL.",X_train

I am also a bit of a history buff and even though this may not be from Japan, it is of the type used for the Japanese Tea Ceremony which I perform among a few friends every once in a while.

I've been on a raw kale in my smoothie kick for a few months now and wanted to change it up.<br /><br />The price was decent for the amount of servings. The product seems fairly high quality as far as i can tell. 2 spoonfuls is a serving. The flavor, i assume would be strong if your smoothie didn't have &#34;stronger&#34; flavor profiles. My protein powder i use has &#34;artificial flavor&#34; which helps mask the taste a little (and bananas too). I can tell that it would be an overwhelming &#34;green&#34; vege taste, which might be a problem for some. I usually chug my shakes/smoothies, so the taste wouldn't really matter that much, but be warned.<br /><br />I did notice a bump in energy on certain days i use it, but that might be a mental thing. I have no adverse effects/reactions taking it so that's always a good thing. I'll see how i feel when i switch back to raw kale for a week for a comparison.",X_train
2176,"This monitor works fine. I'm happy with the range and that there isn't any interference. The VOX setting is great, but doesn't always work. For instance, when the unit is turned off and then back on again, it doesn't always remember that VOX should be &#34;ON&#34;. So if you want it on, you have to make sure it's actually on every time you turn the unit on. The other problem with the VOX setting is that sometimes it doesn't turn itself back on when the baby is crying. I've had a handful of instances where I wake up in the middle of the night to my baby crying from his room, but my monitor is still in the VOX &#34;sleep mode&#34;. Overall, this monitor is okay and it does what I need it to do (most of the time). It's worth keeping though as I don't feel it necessary to go through the process of finding another one that may not work any better (have had issues with Lavana monitors in the past and won't ever buy one of theirs again). One more thing is that I wish there were indicator lights on the monitor that registered the baby's cries so that the sound could be turned all the way down and you could still see whether the baby was crying.",X_train

2178,"I love Bob's Red Mill products and this oat flour is no exception.  However, it is not quite as versatile as some of the other flours from Bob's (for example, their whole wheat pastry flour).<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*long-lasting (I bought 4 packages of this more than a year ago; it's been sitting on top of my refrigerator at room temperature, and it's still good; open packages also last a long time)<br />*the pancake recipe on the bag is quite good (and a wonderful way to get away from white flour in pancakes)<br />*can be consumed with minimal to no cooking (e.g. mix some with your oats to thicken your oatmeal in the morning, or put a little in a smoothie)<br />*works nicely in combination with other flours<br />*doesn't clump<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*the pancake recipe, unlike most pancake recipes, can most definitely NOT be used to make waffles (tried it yesterday, ended up completely stuck to the waffle iron despite the use of copious amounts of nonstick cooking spray)<br />*can't do much with it on its own; 2 of the 3 recipes on the bag, for example, require the use of large amounts of other types of flour (this is likely due to the lack of significant amounts of gluten and this flour's inability to absorb liquids -- try pairing this with coconut flour or tapioca starch and you may get better results)<br /><br />Please note that this particular flour is not gluten-free.  While oats do not naturally contain gluten, they become cross-contaminated due to having been processed on equipment that is also used to produce wheat.  If you have celiac disease or a gluten sensitivity, Bob's does make a gluten-free oat flour (but it is not this product).",X_train

2186,"This is the best stroller ever! I took it to Disney World with my 13 month old daughter, she took all of her naps in it and preferred it to her pack-n-play. The sun protection is great, since we were in Florida I did purchase an extension that worked our really well, but for just the normal day at the zoo I don't use it. It folds super quickly and the quality is outstanding. I would recommend this product to anyone. It is worth the price! My sister purchased a small $30 umbrella at Walmart and will be replacing it before her second child, yes this product is more expensive than that. But would easily take 3 children through the stroller days and be able to be sold at a garage sale for $75-100! Now that is a great deal. I also bought the Maclaren stroller bag and that was great for sippy cups and extra supplies since we we at Disney. Highly recommend this, I tried out several other strollers before purchasing this one and I am so glad that I ended up with the Maclaren. It's my favorite stroller by far!",X_train

My son feels like such a big boy and it is nice to have him right there eating like one of us. The chair is easy to clean which is nice too.

All I did was take the stage 2 nipples from my 9oz. bottles and replace them. We used these bottles for a year and never once had a problem with any kind of leaking. I love these bottles because they are so easy to clean. I love the fact that you can take the bottom off to clean. With regular bottles you have to work to get all of the stuff off of the bottom. Believe me this makes cleaning so much easier. I am currently pregnant with my second child and plan to continue to use the Ventair bottles.,X_train

2201,"We have been trying to transition our now 15 months old daughter from a bottle for the last 2 months. She finally forgot about her bottle within just 2 days with this sippy cup. The trick is probably in the soft spout. We have about 5 various sippy cups with hard spouts and she hated them and would always bag for a bottle. She absolutely loves this cup and twice even did not let it go during the bath time. After drinking from this cup for 2 weeks she now doesn't mind other sippy cups either. Now we use sippy cups with hard spouts during the day and this sippy cup for naps/bed time or when she is fussy. It was cheap enough that if it breaks in a few months, I would buy it again. Bought it in Safeway.     I gave it four stars as sometimes when you screw on top too hard the soft top gets out of its placement and may leak. It took us a while to figure it out but once we realized what the problem was we are careful about screwing it on.",X_train

2208,"After my friend absolutely raved about this chair (and because admittedly I'm a brand snob), I bought this chair for my third child without doing any real comparison. Big mistake. Like other reviewers said, the gap between the tray and the baby's belly is HUGE. At least half the food falls into the seat. The tray is huge and does not fit into the dishwasher. It is ridiculously hard to clean---a flaw I think all these type of high chairs share. There are places in this chair where I can see food piling up---and there is absolutely no way to clean it without literally taking the chair apart (gap is too deep and small even for my vaccuum cleaner attachments). I had a $50 Evenflow high chair with my first two children  that had all the features I do like about this one: wheels, easy fold, good recline, adjustable height, and extra tray top. Like all these traditional high chair designs, it is huge and takes up a ton of space. This one is very heavy, and probably is well built (Peg-Perego is a great company), but if you're going to spend this kind of money, I would suggest springing for a more innovative high chair, like the Stokke Tripp Trapp. Otherwise, just get the cheapest high chair you can find.

But to my surprise it tasted a lot better than I expected. It has a slightly sweet flavor at first then after a few chews it kicks it up a notch with a tangy/spicy zest that's very refreshing. Yes the slices are a little thicker than normal, but it's packed with that awesome flavor that you will just enjoy every bite of the way :) I would definitely like to order again when I run out in two years or so lol<br /><br />I recommend this!",X_train

Being able to set him on the couch between us and watch a movie is pretty cool!!<br /><br />Also my 2 year old likes to set in it,...more as a novelty for her, but just to show you that this little seat will be used from at least 4 month to about 12 or 16 months.

Mind you, the brown part is not squishy, it's hard plastic that is enjoyably gummed by my 7 month old.

I am 5'2 120 pounds and my 15 month old is about 25 lbs, so I really needed to find something to help lug her around in.  I tried the Ergo Performance on in a store and only used it as a front pack and thought it was great.  However, once I got it home and used it on my hip I realized just how uncomfortable the performance straps are.  Also the straps are conformed so when you wrap the strap behind you back in the hip carry hold it does not sit comfortably on your back. Not only that but I then put her on my back and once I got everything adjusted correctly the chest strap was almost across my throat and it was pulled down as far as it would go.  I thought maybe it was just me and that it wouldn't do that to my husband who is 5'11, but it did the same thing to him.  Needless to say I brought the Performance back and tried the Ergo Sport and it made a world of difference.

2244,"I now own a total of 4 Nautilus 3-in-1car seats. I am very happy with this product and have been since I purchased the first 2, going back 4 years ago now. We have them set up in each stage in the mini van. My children enjoy having their very own cup holder, and have never complained about a sore backside on long trips. The construction is very solid and it is fairly easy to prepare for the next stage. The material has held up great as well. The new buckle design is very easy to use.",X_train
2245,"I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  The mat is nice and soft; perfect for little babies.  The mat has all kinds of different things to grab, touch, and explore while babies are on their tummies.

So we decided to bite the bullet and spend a little more for a better product and we are so glad we did. I drive a honda accord and the install could not have been easier. With the smaller mirrors you can spend hours trying to find the right angle to see your baby, but with this one you can't NOT see baby, it's huge. I also appreciate the subtle design, lots of these have kid art and I didn't really want that in my car permanently, I do drive around adults from time to time. Just note that if you live a sunny place, like I do, the car seat sun shade pulled down can block your baby's face from both the sun and the mirror.",X_train

2250,"Since chores have very little to do with watching the TV, my wife won't clean anything.  Anything includes this chair.  I clean it about once a week, and I am amazed by how easy the F-P Space Saver High Chair is to clean, so long as you've wrapped it with cellophane and duct tape, and your baby uses a bib made from a 55-gallon trash bag.  Seriously, the arms on this chair must be designed to collect and store enough applesauce and avocado mush to keep your LO (that is mommy-blog-speak for \\""little one\\"") alive through the next zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />Running beneath the armrests of this chair are six semi-circle cut outs and a long grove.  Inside these little semi-circles and the long grooves is storage for 27 lbs of food.  My LO weights 27lbs.  Clearly, no zombie apocalypse would last long enough for my LO to eat his own weight in applesauce and avocado mush.  I have cable TV, and most zombie attacks last one season, the equivalent of a month.  The food stored in this chair would last approximately two months; much too long.<br /><br />I write this review for the benefit of the Chief Fisher-Price Furniture Design Engineer: This chair is nearly perfect.  Eliminate the zombie apocalypse food storage feature of this chair, and I will buy thousands more.",X_train

2264,"I gave it a 5 star rating because of the toughness and comfort of this stroller. I would have given it 4.5 stars (if I could) only because of the lack of cargo space. The netting below the seat is a nice feature, it just doesn't fit that much. However, we put a small backpack over the handles against the manufactures recommendations (we must be terrible parents) and made due.  Anyway, we bought this to take on a 14+ day multi-destination trip and wanted a stroller that would pack easy yet be comfortable for our 2yr-old.  It lived up to expectations.  I drove this stroller off the curb (fully loaded with backpack and child) every time we left our hotel in the first week (many times a day) and this thing is still working great.  For an umbrella stroller, it seemed to be comfortable as our daughter slept in it many times for full naps while we were out on excursions (the reclining is a nice feature). The stuff sack and carrying strap are handy; the strap can be used on the stroller itself and the bag.",X_train

It looked cheap and flimsy and like it should go right to the trash....<br />However, I have now been using it for about 6 months and it's holding up well. I do place a towel over it to absorb any water from my sons splashing. For the price, its probably worth it! Much cheaper than the designer ones and it does the job. I would make sure to be more careful with it and it definitely cannot be washed. You can wipe it down though and as long as you have a towel over it there shouldnt be much to clean anyway. Its basically a thin foam board, dries pretty easily if it gets wet. You get what you pay for, and i would probably buy it again because its so cheap and it has worked just fine.",X_train

It also has the perfect setting of vibration and the music it plays is just beautiful, not like cheesy, cartoony lullaby music.",X_train

Not even one drop - this has stevia in it so I was worried it would be too sweet, but it's not overly sweet at all.  Just a hint of sweetness that compliments the spice.

Also the checklist review at the end of each segment is beyond helpful !<br /><br />What is so different about this set is it has real life parents with real babies. Not some dolls like most baby films have. You are watching REAL families. And they have actual baby care experts in this particular movie. In the two discs they cover almost everything you need to know about having/raising kids. And also a lot that most parents don't think of ! Because, it isn't something that pops into your head. Like the finding childcare, sleep routine, adjusting to parenthood and things of that nature. Those tend to be overlooked with choosing how you will feed your baby, where baby will sleep, baby doctors and etc.<br /><br />I personally learn better by watching real demonstrations.

Even with me making it as low as possible, still make my back hurt. I think this is because of the carrier design where there is not enough support for your back. Should include another strap that go around your back or one at the waist as currently, only the shoulder strap is at your back and I don't think that's enough support.<br /><br />Other than that, it's so easy to use so when I go out with my baby, I will carry these (although I may have back pain after coming back home).",X_train

I use a pour-over method when making coffee, and I never have a problem with paper filters, so I'm confident that it's not what I'm doing.  It's the composition of the filters.

2323,"When putting this thing together, it might be wise to leave off the pink sleeve on the main arm.  The mobiles tend to hit the sleeve, stopping the rotation.  This can be quite frustrating, especially for a baby that enjoys movement.    Pros - Music volume is great, and a single windup lasts a few minutes.  Cons - The figures get stuck on the arm sleeve when passing, freezing the mobile in place.    Would I buy again - No.  For the price, I would rather get a cheaper model that worked as designed",X_train

Velcro loops are heavy duty, so the bag will easily hold a heavy load if needed.  We got it to hang on our UppaBaby umbrella stroller.  full disclosure - we have another stroller organizer that we have hanging on our full size Quinny stroller - purchased it recently for $15 - but it looks and feels like a piece of rag compared to our new ZenKid organizer.  This organizer is definitely a MONEY WELL SPENT!  Thinking of returning our $15 buy and purchasing another ZenKid organizer.

They can rock side to side or rotate the swing to rock front to back.  The mobile spins, there's a mirror, and multiple sound options.  There is both music and nature sounds.  As he got heavier we had to up the swing setting to the highest level but it is still working great at 15lbs even though he now doesn't care for it as much.  The first 3 months of his life though it's the only reason I ever got chores or cooking done.  Be sure you always physically start the swing and you shouldn't have any issues with this model.  If you do Fisher Price's customer service is amazing.  Go to their online chat and they are quick to resolve any issues.",X_train

2369,"The first time I made this tea, I brewed it hot- the scent and flavor was so strongly vegetal that it tasted like roasted corn and I just didn't have the stomach for it. I left it to sit on the counter for a few days, not sure what I would do with it, when I decided I should give it a try iced.<br /><br />WOW. What a difference! I first brewed the tea hot in a standard size french press, then drained the brew into another pitcher. I added a generous squirt of honey (perhaps 1.5 tbsp) and left it in the fridge to cool overnight. The result is absolutely fantastic. That sharp corn taste has been muted significantly by sweetness of the honey, leaving the tea tasting so much smoother with a slight grassy flavor. If you enjoy Honest Tea's Honey Green bottled tea, you will ADORE Majani Tea's Faraja tea iced with a dash of honey. Honestly, I can't even go back to buying Honest Tea after this. Great job Majani!",X_train

Right off I can say that for ECing under 12 mos, you want to go with the Bjorn little potty or the Thermobaby Anatomical potty.<br /><br />Con:<br />-This one is a little too big for 6-10 month olds being that its a little higher and wider, making it more difficult to get into the natural squatting position that is most effective for elimination.<br />-Bjorn is pricey.<br />-Since there's no lift on the back, as with the Themobaby, it's sometimes hard to aim when helping him sit, I hate when he's too far forward and pee spills over the front.<br /><br />Pro:<br />-The bowl is easier to empty, the front is easy to lift out and secure to hold. I like that the contents go out the back instead of over the front like the one piece potties. This feature also makes it much easier to clean.<br />-It has rubber lining on the bottom so it doesn't scoot around.

These really aren't much better than candy, as the top ingredient is organic cane sugar, but I do like them much better than most fruit snacks - as another reviewer mentioned, they are very reminiscent of those candy fruit slices, soft and chewy with good flavor. At least these are a bit healthier though than candy with good ingredients and vitamins, etc. but they are still best kept as just a special once-in-awhile treat. If you can keep the kids away from them, they are so tasty, I have a hard time only having one pack! I like the Berry flavor best but the Tropical mix is good too. Right now as I am writing this review, these are only available through a 3rd party seller for much too high a price, but they've been available on Subscribe-and-Save for around $12 so I would wait for a price more in that range to buy them again.",X_train
2425,"My daughter received 2 hematomas from attempting to extract during childbirth. These later hardened and I believe made her keep her head in one position too long while laying which cause some flattening. Anyway, it is VERY soft and my daughter reaches to feel it when I lay her on it. I can't say for sure that it's working as she is at a stage where she moves all the time anyway, but her head is getting rounder and I have a bit more peace of mind. I wish that the Pediatrician or anyone would have told me about it maybe during one of the trillion times they mentioned \\""back to sleep\\"". Just seems like a logical thing to use if your baby is always on their back.",X_train
2426,I like the product. I have purchased this at the supermarket before.  Buying from Amazon is alot easier then having to go to the store.  Also getting two at a time makes it alot easier for me.  We love waffles and pancakes  so we use alot of this syrup.,X_train

It is a great distraction for traveling and educational too at a great price.",X_train

2445,"Absolutely love this stuff! Been drinking it for 20 years. The original &#34;cowboy coffee&#34; with a cellophane-wrapped peppermint stick in each bag, just as it was 100 years ago. It is said that the trail cook used the peppermint to bribe cowboys to help with some of the chores (sugar being a rare commodity). Full-bodied, just good, solid great-tasting coffee. Sitting out on my deck, in boots and my old Wranglers, watching the sun come up, nursing my cup of Arbuckle's, I close my eyes and I can smell the sagebrush and saddle leather! This is not one of those fancy-dandy coffees for wusses and &#34;pilgrims&#34; from back east; no, sir.  Arbuckle's is straight-up, &#34;with the bark on&#34;, and  it'll open your eyes and get you back in the saddle, pronto, amigo! You will NOT be disappointed.",X_train

I think it would also work well, barely salted, in sushi, but I haven't tried yet; the stickiness and texture at least are perfect for sushi and rice balls.<br />If you're using a rice cooker, find the places where the steam condenses on your cooker, and clean those areas extra thoroughly after making this rice.  Like all sticky rice, this rice has a starchy steam that will make a mess if you don't clean it up.",X_train
2449,"I really like the hat that came with this set and it fit my 3lb preemie nicely.  However, I have not been able to put the onesie on him because it's not NICU approved.  The sleepsuit however is NICU approved but I was not crazy about the fit.  I did not like how the feet part is straight down.  I think it should have a foot part for the feet to fit in it comfortably.  The sleeves were also too short. It's a nice set idea but could use some adjustments.",X_train

2454,"Very cute, good quality, fits a tub of wipes, a receiving blanket, and about six diapers.  I wish it was a little bit bigger, and that was the only thing that kept me from giving it five stars, but it is big enough for what I needed.  Great to keep downstairs for diaper changes so we don't always have to go upstairs to the nursery.  It will also be great to use for other things when we are out of diapers, which was one reason I chose this instead of a regular diaper caddy.",X_train
2455,"I wanted a lemon pepper seasoning. I thought this product would at least have a nice lemon zing to it . It did not. However, the other spices in this lemon pepper seasoning made it a good general seasoning. I found I could use it in foods where I did not need lemon but some seasoning. It worked good as a general seasoning but not for seasoning foods like fish or chicken when bold lemon  flavor is needed.",X_train

2457,"I really like these. You can taste the dark chocolate. It's sweet & gluten free. A bit pricey however. But MUCH BETTER than the super hard & sticky regular kind bars that have way more total fat, too. Not that that's an entirely bad thing; for me personally, I have plenty of healthy fat options in my diet, so sometimes I don't need the overkill.

2461,"These were wonderful. Because of the reviews I decided to get 3 brands and compare. No connoisseur, however, you still know what is good and what is not. I found these to be tasty, crunchy and fresh with a very nice flavor. I did not find any significant difference between the 3, to tell the truth. They were all organic and raw and to me, they were comparable. None of the 3 stood out as being that much better or worse then the others.  I would buy again, these were shipped fast, as described, great tasting and I just love finding new ways to use them.",X_train
2462,"I got these set to avoid the snap marks on the skin from using G-diapers. Originally I was attracted to diaper covers I did not need to wash with every single change, however, they tend to leak, the velcros don't work so well after a month, and for it to leak less you need to put it tight which hurts my baby's skin.<br />I guess it is an ok option if you run out of other diaper covers and are at home able to change your little one every 1 to 2 hrs.<br />I would not travel with these at all!",X_train
2463,"I was able to try this out for free through Bzzagent and I have to say that the vanilla cappuccino is definitely better tasting than the mocha.  It actually has more of a vanilla as well as a coffee flavor to it.  It did however taste a little chalky to me and that is why I'm only giving it 2 stars.  I would prefer it to taste a little better and not so much like a diet drink.  I believe a lot of people will like this flavor, but it's just not for me.",X_train
2464,"I used these with my first so I bought some more for this go round.  I'm still pleased with them.  They aren't as soft as the more expensive brands, but they are more leak-proof.  The softer side is placed against your body while the rougher side (which you never feel) prevents your bra from getting damp.  My other pads are the same material on both sides so I've had seepage from all 3 other brands I have-but not these.  They are flat, but that doesn't present a problem-and I'm a 38D.  The seamed \\""coned\\"" pads don't do anything for me that these don't do.  They are a little smaller than the more expensive pads, but that hasn't made a difference, either.  If your nursing bra is lined, they don't show through-I'm not sure any pad would be invisible with an unlined bra.  I don't hand wash-I throw them in a lingerie bag with my bras and then air dry.  All in all, they do the job and I'd buy them again.",X_train
2465,It does the job.  It's white so it blends in well and doesn't compel our toddler to play with it.  It stays in place and works well.  I appreciate that it has a hole in the top for the shower pull.,X_train

I can tell you that the each bite from the big blob was delicious....sugary and fruity. Any individual pieces I was able to break off was just as tasty and I could tell the distinct flavors.,X_train
2472,"Very glad we got this one. Love the drawers - keep extra diapers, wipes, ointments, q-tips, etc very handy. The laundry compartment is great too. Very easy to change my son and just toss out his dirty clothes right there. When it's time for laundry, the basket just slides right out and goes with me -although I DO wish it stood on its own outside the table, but that's not a real problem. Great height. Lightweight and easy to move, but very study. I have no real complaints about it. There's even enough space on the top to change my son and still keep the wipes warmer and a bottle of hand sanitizer right there. I'd definately recommend it. (Plus I bought it at Amazon.com cheaper than  the company sold it. Always a plus.) =0)",X_train
2473,"It's a great idea for parents of newborns. It makes night time feedings in those early weeks easier because you aren't getting out of bed, you just roll over and tend to your baby.

It would have been better if the little yellow bar could be moved to provide extra length for your fast growing baby.",X_train

2477,"These glazed apricots were very disappointing.  They had a distinctive chemical taste.  We bought them for an extended hiking trip and dumped them the first chance we had.  Generally glazed apricots (admittedly purchased at a higher per pound price) are a great treat and it is hard to stop at eating just one.  The four of us each ate just two and those we ate three days apart, thinking it might have been something other than the WE Go Nuts product that made the first one so disappointing.

2480,"My 6 year old begged for this and I finally found his size here. It arrived quickly and exactly as described. The feet are a bit big which made for some awkward walking (but again it IS Tweety bird). The velcro that attaches them to the child's shoes is definitely not strong enough, but I was able to tie and untie them instead without difficulty. My son wore it to school and had a great trick-or-treating with it. It also helped that it's nice and warm so he needed very little underneath and didn't add to the bulk. I highly recommend the product and this particular company.",X_train

I don't fault the makers of the product, I just personally can't stand the taste and texture of flax granola.",X_train

I usually like a thin-rim on something I'm going to use for water, but the thicker rim on this cup works nicely, so no complaints.<br /><br />These cups are sturdy and sure-footed.

I was eating the product while typing this.<br /><br />First, it takes 16 minutes to cook. I don't mind this.<br /><br />Then theres the texture, look, etc.. The color of this meal is the average Mac and Cheese color; yellow. Its not too yellow, which is good. The liquidness( yes, this meal is somewhat liquidy ) of this meal looks a bit disgusting. The smell is also a little stinky.<br /><br />Finally, the taste. First, try a Cheddar Goldfish Cracker( I ate the Colors version of a Cheddar Goldfish Cracker ). Yum! Now try the Mac and Cheese. It actually kinda tastes like a Goldfish Cracker. The texture of the Goldfishes also feels good in your mouth.<br /><br />Other good things include the ''Comix''.

I drink it when I'm working outside for long periods of time on hot days, and it keeps me hydrated and helps me tolerate the heat.<br /><br />One nice thing about this particular product is that the three small containers make the Gatorade stay fresh longer.

We usually have the A/C on most of the Spring, Summer, and early Fall so I wish that it had longer “sleeves” to the product to keep her arms warm as they can get cold sometimes as she sleeps, but she tends to like the movability.

2519,"Capers look and taste very good. They have a very vivid green color. Much better taste than the ones in vinegar.<br />These are salt cured. To use the, rinse them for a few seconds with fresh water, and then, place them in some cold or warm water for a few minutes. You might need to change the water 1 time, to help eliminate the salt faster.<br />Hole process shouldn't take you over 10/15 minutes.<br />I also use the ones cured in vinegar, but I love these. Size is normal, nor the large or the very little ones.",X_train
2520,"This is the first Stevia I ever bought.  I liked it when I got it...until I tasted other brands.  It's OKAY.  But I prefer the stuff in the packets (dry.)  I especially LOVE the crystals that are made out of a stevia/cane sugar mix--and they're only 5 calories per packet and I only put one packet in my coffee....I guess I need to find that product and review it-ha!<br /><br />But this is definitely worth a try.  It's cheap and lasts a LONG time.  I think it tastes much better in tea, than coffee though.",X_train

2523,These baby toddler beads come in very handy when your child gets fussy when teething.  Most teethers get lost but not this stylish teething necklace.  It conveniently hangs around you neck so you always know where it's at.  It looks like a real necklace that you can wear with any outfit.  It cleans up easily also.  The teething necklace really is great for those teething babies.  I received this product for a discounted price for my fair and honest review.,X_train
2524,"These side cargo nets are so useful.  Our City Versa already has a big basket but I wanted to keep smaller items handy so I got this side cargo net.  It's so useful.  I need extra socks, grocery bags and snacks in it.  We use the stiller everyday for walks so we keep it stocked with extra things.  The cargo net is so useful if you like things organized instead of just at the bottom of the basket.<br /><br />It will fit any stroller since it attaches with two wide Velcro strapes.  What a great product!",X_train

2526,I used to buy this at Sam's Wholesale Club until they discontinued it.  While is is pricey now that it is sold through Amazon it is still the best decaffeinated coffee available in my humble opinion.  The flavor is bold and aromatic and I mix it with the Member's Mark regular Columbian Supremo Whole Bean coffee to make a half caff. blend.  I will continue to buy this as long as it is available.  The flavor is the best in decaf coffees.,X_train
2527,"After spending two hours in the store checking out all the other systems, we decided on this one and can't be happier. It is lightweight, easy to use, sturdy and easy to clean. The car seat installs into the key fit base and stroller with the ease of one hand and the key fit base is just as easy to install. Just enough storage space for gadgets and bags. Highly recommended.",X_train

When my package arrived I could smell the yummy Earl Grey scent waft out of the box as soon as I opened the standard Amazon packaging. I immediatly put on my copper tea kettle to boil water so I could taste this heavently scented tea.     I made my cup of tea with a bit of honey and a splash of organic milk and sat down to drink. I was very happy with the flavor of this tea and will purchase this brand again when I run out. I normally drink Bigelow tea purchased in the grocery store but as of this writting I have not seen an organic Earl Grey tea in my local grocery stores.     Choice Organic Earl Grey Tea + Honey + Organic Milk + Toasted English Mufffin with butter and marmalade = the best breakfast in the world!,X_train
2534,"After struggling for hours with the Fort Knox worthy security seal on the top of the container, we finally determined that it was NOT NECESSARY to turn the cap to remove it. Another reviewer referred to the cap as red and &#34;twisty&#34; but &#34;twisting&#34; the cap only causes it to REVOLVE around and around, not allowing access to the product inside. Finally my daughter found a video online that demonstrated the opening process, which involves peeling a tab from the base of the cap, which then SNAPS off the container. Some simple directions would have been most HELPFUL to my family. Additionally, there should be a WARNING LABEL to advise consumers that the milk can POUR from the container with excess volume. I can see why customers often purchase paper towels along with this product.",X_train

2538,This is an outstanding coffee.  I like a flavorful cup of joe in the morning (or anytime) and this one is rich without being too dark.

I've ordered it a couple times now and have never been disappointed.  Great quality.  Thanks!,X_train

When I looked more closely, the middle seam along the back was completely unglued, so the entire contents dumped into the box.  I opened a puffy bag and over the next few days my wife and I consumed the whole bag.  Our consensus?  Really stale tasting.<br /><br />The worst part was that the 12-pack of chips, and these are LARGE bags, expired in 25 days.  Are you serious?<br /><br />I complained to Amazon and got a refund.  I will never try this again.  I'll pay more and buy locally one bag at a time.",X_train

The product description on Amazon is a little lacking so I'm not sure.   There were 5 different packets to go with the rice noodles: Dehydrated herbs/veggies, Regular Seasoning, Beef Packet (actual chunks of beef, packet reminded me of an MRE), Hoisen Sauce, and some kind of chili sauce.   This is a far more substantial meal than what you normally get from an instant noodle. You have to add hot water and microwave it so it takes slightly longer but it's well worth it. I highly recommend and I would like to try other flavors.",X_train

It's huge (it can be wrapped around my 2.5 year old) and lightweight but warm enough when it has to be, breathable and lovely.  I looked at this for a long time (I have the swaddle muslin blankets for my newborn that I love) and will probably get another one for the baby when he's bigger.  I was hesitant because of the price but it is worth every penny.  Wish I had a blanket like this in an adult size!!  Editted to add--just purchased my second dream blanket.  Can't say enough good things about this blanket.  My son is now 10 months and sleeps with it covering him in his crib--it's big enough that I can drape it over his lower half and as he wiggles around he still stays partially covered.  Really worth the price even if it is spendy.",X_train

When you're pregnant and already tossing and turning, to have your face against rough fabric is really...frustrating.  Also, the multiple pieces are attached together with velcro.  When you (again) are tossing and turning at night, the velcro comes apart, leading to further frustration as you try to hold all the pieces together or reassemble the damn thing IN THE DARK without waking your husband.  Does this sound relaxing and capable of producing happy pregnant lady sleep? No.<br /><br />The parts, when assembled, are awesome.

I have previously tried and reviewed the [[ASIN:B001IZI0RG Jack Links Chew, Original Flavor, 0.32-Ounce Units (Pack of 24)]]. That stuff tasted like ground up cardboard and pepper that blows away when you open the can. Buffalo Bill's chew is has plenty of flavor, but also is actual shredded (not ground) jerky. The only fault is that occasionally you might get a little chunk that's too big for your lip, which makes it kind of painful. But I usually just chew those right up anyhow. This chew is neither too dry nor too moist.    I like to use jerky chew when riding horses or working in dusty conditions, as it helps keep my mouth moist. And though it's not laced with caffine or nicotine, it does help keep you awake because it keeps your mouth and mind busy.     I will say without a doubt that this is the best jerky chew I've tried thus far. Even my kids like it!",X_train

The fasteners are large enough to be usable for little hands and the bear is cute enough that she likes it as a doll, not just when she wants to practice changing clothes.  It is very durable, and all of the fasteners look like they will hold up for awhile.  The only items that seem a little flimsy are the sneakers.

What drives me nuts is that EVERY SINGLE BOX has broken creamers. I wish there was a  better way to put it.<br /><br />I've purchased products that were liquid / fragile from Amazon Prime before and this is the first I've encountered with this dissatisfaction. This is probably because of the cheap plastic used by Nestle (who owns Coffee Mate) that lets it, while in individual containers, break easily and leak everywhere.<br /><br />This will bother you in three ways. For one, the smell will drive you nuts (no matter how much you like vanilla.) Two, the stickyness is a disaster given how cramped all the creamers are in the box.

2610,"When my sister had her children she had the original baby bjorn. I had never heard of it nor seen such a contraption. It was so handy and made her life easier. When it was my turn to have a baby I registered for the baby bjorn active. I've only used it once so far because my baby is only 4 weeks old. It took a little while to figure out the strap adjustments because the directions weren't very clear. It may look intimidating when you take it out of the box, but it isn't at all. It's great to wear around the house while doing some chores like laundry or vacuuming. My baby loves to be carried and cuddled all the time and this allows me to do just that and get some things done around the house too. A must have for this first time mommy.",X_train

2623,"I'm trying to cut down on added sugars and a lot of dried fruit has added sugars.  (I like to add dried fruit to my oatmeal.)  So, I decided to try freeze-dried fruit instead.  Freeze-dried fruit is just fruit, with nothing else added.  I loved the strawberries from this brand, so I just had to check out the mango.<br /><br />I put a couple of tablespoons of these (they're diced into chunks maybe 1/4 inch on a side) in my oatmeal, then add hot water from the dispenser at work.  (I also add chia seeds and walnuts and cinnamon.)  The mango chunks rehydrate pretty quickly and end up with a texture that is quite similar to that of frozen mango that has been thawed.  (I love that texture!)<br /><br />These definitely have a good mango taste, though you won't mistake them for fresh fruit.  They're light and a little crunchy (but not too hard) if you just eat them on their own.  At any rate, if you are looking for an alternative to traditionally-dried fruit, these are a good bet.  (Also, the current unit price on Amazon is competitive with Whole Foods prices for the same product.)  I think I like the &#34;Just ...&#34; strawberries better, but I like these as well.",X_train

2628,"This is the third car seat that we've gotten for my son and I wish we'd had this one from the start. It's much softer and cushioned that his two previous seats ([[ASIN:B005DQ569Q Graco SnugRide Classic Connect 30 LX Infant Car Seat, Metropolis]] and [[ASIN:B004OEPLJ8 Safety 1st All-in-One Convertible Car Seat, Scribbles]]) and seems much safer. I don't like how other reviewers are saying that you \\""get what you pay for\\"" and complaining that this seat doesn't fit their car. This seat is expensive for a lot of people, not everyone can afford to buy a $300 or more car seat. And if the seat doesn't fit in your car, that doesn't make it a bad seat, so that shouldn't affect the review. We have a 4-door Pontiac G6, and this seat does fit rear-facing in the center of the back seat, and it also fits behind the passenger seat. Yes, the passenger seat had to be pushed forward, but in my opinion it wasn't so far forward that it was unusable. We're having baby #2 in a few months and we plan on getting another Safety 1st Complete Air Protect seat. My son will have to be scooted over from the middle to the side, and so will the new baby, so the \\""wings\\"" next to their heads and the over-all safety rating of the seat make me feel much better about them being right next to the car door. This seat is lightweight, safe, soft, and allows baby/toddler to remain rear-facing longer than a lot of other seats. I have no complaints and I'm pretty picky! I'm so relieved to feel like we've finally found a great car seat.<br /><br />My only suggestion, not really a complaint, but something you may want to purchase with the seat, is strap covers (We had [[ASIN:B004L2JJ6Y Brica Cushies Button Up Strap Covers, Gray/Blue/Green]] that we purchased with his first seat) because this seat doesn't come with any. And an insert, like [[ASIN:B0045VA3SO Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Terry]], if you're going to have a newborn in the seat, or else you'll have to roll up receiving blankets around the baby.",X_train

The back does not bend.  It is very sturdy.  I desperately wanted something smaller for quick trips.  I love my quattro tour stroller, however found it exhausting on errand days! The complaints about this stroller are ridiculous.  As I stated, the back has never bent for me.  It is super easy to recline the seat (which is a wonderful option) and the whole stroller is a snap to fold up and set up.  I do it with my daughter in my arms!  The complaint about storage - again it's great to have the option! Most umbrella strollers do not have this option.  The stroller itself is a breeze to push and just a total time saver. I am 5'10 and my husband is 5'11.  We have no problems pushing this stroller. I highly recommend it.

Glad to be done with the bottles, clutch, et cetera.There's also only the lid and cup.<br />Childproof opening: Our son has figured out a startling number of ways to get into things he shouldn't but hasn't figured out the squeeze/twist which feels almost akin to pharmacy bottles but just slightly easier.<br />No leaks: So that childproof seal has an added benefit of not leaking water all around the edges of the lid.<br />Hydrating: The spout actually allows an easy flow so baby can get sufficient water without struggling.<br />Durable: Not sure what it's made of but it is thick and has taken quite a few falls from the high chair.<br />Visual: My son recognizes it as HIS cup and seems to like the picture.<br />BPA free. I know all the pediatrician pamphlets we get say to avoid BPA so I'm glad that is advertised though to be perfectly honest, I'm not sure what BPA is/does.<br /><br />Con's<br />Not really and I can think of, but it does say 8 months +.

2664,"I love Harney & Sons, Earl Grey tea, and Marcus Samuelsson, so I was so excited to try Ambessa: The Earl of Harlem!  I read other reviews and prepared myself for a rich and smoky experience.  The product arrived and right away I was pleased with the colorful tin, which looks so nice on my shelf and stands out next to my other tea tins.  When I opened the tin, however, I got very worried.  I did not like the smell.  It was TOO smoky, and I thought I could detect notes of tobacco amid the more familiar floral/fruity Earl Grey.  I brewed the kettle and prepared myself for disappointment.<br /><br />Well, I couldn't have been more wrong! The smell that was so strong when I opened the tin diffused in my mug and became the light, smoky, barely-fruity aroma that other reviewers here have described.  I like my Earl Grey with some sweetness, so I added a few drops of Trader Joe's Liquid Stevia and a splash of cream to my cup before tasting.<br /><br />All I can say is...WOW! The flavor of this tea is just incredible, and not what you would expect from the smell of the dry tea.  It's like The Right Honorable Earl Grey went to a speakeasy jazz club (and made a few friends).<br /><br />For fans of traditional Earl Grey the flavor is familiar enough to satisfy your expectations, but the deep smokiness transforms that familiar flavor into something exotic.  Other reviewers have described it as a smoky earl grey, and that's not wrong but it doesn't go far enough.  There's a lot more than just the flavor of smoke -- this tea has a very complex flavor: smoky, floral, fruity, oaky, and even a bit &#34;spicy&#34; (not as in hotness, but as in there are spices in this tea I can't quite describe because I don't think I've tasted them before).  Earl of Harlem definitely kicks it up a notch! You can definitely recognize it as an Earl Grey but at the same time it's its own thing and strongly distinct from any other Earl Grey out there.  So if you're a bit adventurous but still appreciate tradition, this tea is for you.radition, this tea is for you.",X_train

I have a 9 month old and a 2 1/2 year old and they love it as well, with all the different seating options.(my youngest likes to face me, and my oldest facing the other way so he can see.) It is a heavier and larger stroller, but I don't have a problem with it. I actually like it, because it makes our strolls more of a workout:) This stroller fits through standard door ways, and if in a store I keep the seats so they are facing each other to make the stroller a bit smaller. One last thing, this is a very durable stroller! I live in a city with a lot of old railroad tracks (raised up with the wood and metal) crossing over our streets and sidewalks. None of my older strollers made it over them but this one went over them very easily for a stroller. It also does very well on our unpaved trails. This is a wonderful stroller at a great price; paid 200 for mine at the baby depot.",X_train
2717,"I've now owned my K-cup machine for just over a year now and have tried many coffees.  This particular coffee is part of my conclusion.  I'm not a purist.  I like the flavored coffees more than the others.  This is my favorite chocolate flavored blend.  It's dark enough for that real coffee result.  The chocolate flavor does not have that common chemical aftertaste.  And there is enough almond flavor to enhance the overall experience.  I hope Amazon starts carrying it again-and in the 50 (frustration free) pack would be nice.<br /><br />UPDATE  25Dec 2009<br />Well if you have not heard, Tully's will not longer be manufacturing this particular coffee.<br />How sad for all of us.

I would definitely recommend this mix.  Raspberry butter between layers would be wonderful, too.",X_train

I apply it every time to prevent rashes.<br /><br />Con: It's pretty solid so you have to press hard with your finger to get some, or rub the pad of your finger in a circular motion several times to get enough product on your finger. If you have any nail at all, you'll scoop some right into your nail, needing you to dig it out, which is kind of icky feeling.",X_train
2721,"Five years ago, I purchased an Evenflo highchair similar to this and I loved it. My son spent a lot of time in there, because as our house was wheelchair accessible, it was a breeze to roll him from room to room or even up and down the wheelchair ramp outside. The adjustable height was a huge selling point, as we didnt always eat at the dining room table so we could raise/lower depending on where we were at the time. Also, REALLY easy to fold up and stick in the car. With a stroller in my trunk, the highchair would fit in the front seat of my Subaru Legacy and those have a smaller interior than most sedans.    Fast forward five years to my recent purchase of the Evenflo Right Height. I searched Amazon because my local stores didn't carry Evenflo highchairs and I loved my first one so much (lasted about 1.5 yr with us and is still in use with my younger cousin) I wasn't going to waste my time with another brand. When the box arrived and I saw all of the pieces I was a litte overwhelmed- but the instructions are clear and it only took me 10 minutes from opening the box until my girl was sitting in it.    I love the pink/greyscale print of the cushion and the one handed tray attach/removal- perfect for the bottle mixing parent on the fly :) The cushion is easily removable, washable and more cushiony than others I've seen. Definitely not the hard rubber/plastic pad that was on my highchair when I was little! My daughter loves sitting up like a big girl, but if she happens to fall asleep while eating the 3 position reclining seatback (also one hand operational) will make sure she doesn't hurt her little neck. I also like the removable tray 'liner' which makes clean up a little faster/easier.     For how much use I expect to get out of it, the price was right too. I'm always happy to pay more for quality, but in this case it was superb quality with a reasonable price. Would definitely buy again for our next child in five years :)",X_train

2725,"So far, the best solution we've found for keeping the water out of our two sons' eyes. It works best when it is worn upside down as the picture shows, with the visor facing &#34;upward&#34; (if it's worn down, like a poker player, the water still cascades down in front of their faces, making them freak out). Also, our older son's head is narrow, so we have to tilt it up a little, in order to create a better seal around his head. And when it comes to our infant son....he HATES hats, so for now, this doesn't work for him, but in time, when he realizes the benefits of keeping this hat on in order to keep the water out of his eyes, I'm sure he'll want to keep it on too. Overall, 4/5 stars because it works most of the time, and we have about 80% tear free nights of washing hair. :)",X_train

No red, no yellow, none of that.  Don't expect it.<br /><br />2) The pot has a drainage hole in the bottom, but does *not* come with a tray.

2749,"We bought this glider/rocker to put in our 2nd baby's room.  When looking to purchase, I was attracted to it's dark wood finish, the fact that it is hard wood, that the ottoman in included with the purchase and that the chair has settings to allow it to recline and not rock.    First of all, the chair is really attractive.  I got it in Espresso which matched perfectly with my Black/Cherry Simmons baby furniture.  Upon trying it out, I was a bit disappointed.  It is definitely a smaller rocker.  I am 5'2\\"" and weigh about 127 when not pregnant.  My husband is 5'7\\"" and about 160 pounds.  This rocker fits us very snugly, but if we were larger people, we would not be comfortable in it.  Also, even though it's supposed to have extra plush padding, the padding is very firm, although it is thicker than some other rockers.  Additionally, it is lacking in lumbar support so it doesn't have the best shape to the back pad.  I've found that adding a neck roll to the lumbar area or putting a pillow behind the pad on the rocker helps this a bit, but still isn't the most comfortable.    Baby is still not here yet, so I've yet to try it's effectiveness as a nursing chair.  I think it'll work fine, but I don't think I'll be falling asleep in it like I did with my daughter's rocker/glider chair (for which I paid less in a local furniture outlet store).",X_train

It fills me up so that I don't crave soda, cookies, candy, etc.  It does hit the sweet spot due to the varieties of sugar in it.  Since I'm eating healthy and working out - I don't see a negative with allowing this in my diet.  Would love if they offered coupons",X_train
2751,"I got my coffee at Big Lots marked down to $5.50, apparently not a big seller in the south. First off the coffee is not white. That is the name of the brand. However with a name like &#34;white&#34; and being a breakfast blend light roast I didn't expect a robust coffee and I didn't get one. The taste was almost nonexistent which means whatever flavored creamer (white chocolate this time) I used, I could taste fully without the coffee interfering with the creamer flavor...for what that is worth.<br /><br />The biggest problem is the packaging. The coffee comes in mesh K-cups with lids that hang sloppily over the cup as if they are to be pulled off. They are not. Also the inner package is not resealable so your coffee is exposed to air. I have a Star Wars popcorn tin I use to seal the coffee box.

I had hoped this would be the last car seat I would have to buy, but it seems as though it isn't the case.

The dial for speed gives the impression that there are more speeds than their are, but the available speeds are fine, and this is just a suggestion for improvement.  What I like the most is that the milk does not travel into the pump unit or through tubes.  The parts are easy to clean.  Their customer service is great!  My pump started acting weird about a month in, and they replaced it.  For any mother going back to work, I recommend buying an extra set of parts if you won't be able to wash your parts easily on your break.  It takes a little strategy, but I was able to get the extra set of parts in the bag with everything else.  Another tip: I learned that the cooler is not waterproof, so if you forget the freezer packs (like I did on my first day at work), do not put loose ice in it.",X_train
2782,"I did not purchase my pump through Amazon.  It was covered by insurance and purchased through a medical supplier; however, this thing is so bad I feel compelled to write a review.  It is not an exaggeration when I say my hand pump works better.  In fact, I have resorted to using my hand pump while I wait for a replacement from a different brand.  I’ve been using my pump regularly for about 2 months and after ongoing issues it is no longer working.  I have replaced all of the parts with the exception of the pump itself to no avail.<br /><br />-  One of the flanges cracked at the base within the first 2 weeks<br />-  I’ve gone through about 4 sets of pump valves, two sets in the last two weeks.  They are very delicate and get little micro-tears in the bottom, rendering suction useless.<br />-  Sometimes milk does not flow through the valve into the bottle.  For whatever reason, the milk pools in the valve and eventually gets sucked up into the tubing….yes, sucked into the tubing.  The exact opposite of what Ameda advertises.<br />-  The diaphragm sometimes gets sucked into air input/output hole and clogs it up<br />-  The writing rubs off of the storage bottles with only hand washing<br />-  The pump makes a horrible beeping noise with every suction.  I could live with this if the pump actually worked.<br /><br />Not cool Ameda…very poor quality.",X_train
2783,"After having highchairs that were hard to clean I wanted to find a booster that was easy to clean and move around from our house to g-parents and restaurants. This seat has worked great! Since it is one solid piece you only have to wipe it down and not all sorts of crevices and pieces. The foam material it is made out of is comfortable for my boys to sit on and it hasn't stained. The straps are easy to remove and wash in the sink or washing machine when needed. As for traveling, it is easy to remove and attach to seats, it's compact and even comes with a sturdy traveling case. I highly recommend this booster for any parent looking for a quick cleanup and ease of use.",X_train

It should also be noted that Koolaid does not have any potassium.<br /><br />Well, the first thing I did with this drink is I drank it myself and for an adult (ignore the cartooney dinosaur with the guitar) it was quite good.  It went very well with my sandwich and chips.  The next thing I did was give this drink to my 2 year old grandson and he drank it (all) but not as enthusiastically as he does other boxed juices.  He often joins his parents for a cup of pretty sugary iced tea and this drink I think was not as sugary as what he was expecting from a boxed drink.  But, he did drink all of it.  That, I think, is saying a lot.  If you do not commonly give your children sugary drinks, then they will probably like this.  As it is, my grandson does seem to drink it down to the bottom, even if sugary iced tea is a possibility at home.

Near the finish of one of these you can pick up hints of watermelon and anise (pretty consistent but faint hints show up - it could just be me and over cinnamoned taste buds by then...)<br /><br />I have deducted one star because... there is ALWAYS wrapper stuck to the INSIDE of every sucker.

I want to tell the manufacturer though- please consider that someone needs to remove the stickers from the tray that you needlessly put on there. It took me longer to remove the stickers in the tan inset of the tray, than it did to set up the entire chair! darned stickers! But other than that (a minor issue really), awesome set up.<br /><br />Trial run:  I put my 20 month old in it and it seemed to hold up very well. Sturdy, attractive, comfortable for him.  The design is simple and to the point.  It makes much more sense than the Evenflo that was handed down to me and broke very quickly with my son squirming around in it. I like the idea that I can move it to a dining chair and use it as a booster with the belts to keep my son seated at the table for meals. The transition between the highchair and putting it on a regular table chair seems simple and safe.<br /><br />UPDATE (almost 2 months of daily use): Everything on this highchair is easily washable- very few nooks for food to gunk up. The tray insert can be put in the dishwasher- so that's nice. I have not used it in the dishwasher (only handwashed) - but the tan insert snaps in and out easily.  I have to say THAT is a life saver. It is so easy to clean!!!! The dark brown part of the tray and leg divider are all in one piece. That is nice because you can lift it out as well so food does not get gunked up around the legs. Once you can take the tray out, it's to easy brush off any dropped food from the seat. The dotted back insert also comes out for older children and washes very nicely on a gentle cycle.<br /><br />Overall- I love this highchair and the ease of operation it provides. It has made meal time much easier. And my child is much more comfortable in it than he was in our previous chair. I highly recommend it.",X_train

A 12 ounce can of spam is about Two Dollars so this clean tasting product is a much better choice.

It hit the same notes as a Vietnamese Banh Mi sandwich without the concern over what zactly is in that inexpensive pate.  I don't eat sausage very often and I probably won't buy any more for a long time.     This sausage is at least 50% fat nubbins.

It is hard to have a full size carry on if you're pushing a regular stroller.  Besides, if you're lugging along the car seat for the child to use on the plane, then you may as well put it to good use in the terminal.

2845,"Summary: Outer &#34;PUL&#34; fabric does not repel moisture, it absorbs it; resulting in a soaking wet outfit and bedding. Leak starts from leg and radiates outward within 90 minutes of putting the diaper on the baby. Snaps are VERY hard to snap (could be a good thing if you've got a crawler).<br /><br />Details: At the time of review, my daughter is 10 weeks old, and all 6 of my GoGreen diapers leak within approximately 90 minutes of her wearing them. The leaks always occur at the leg, never over the top or back.<br /><br />I am a scientist, so I have been extremely rigorous in my &#34;experiments&#34; to prevent these diapers from leaking. Since they were first purchased, they have always been laundered according to the instructions (dry stored in a wet bag, washed at the correct water temperature, chlorine/dye/fragrance/enzyme free detergent without fabric softener, and  always INDOOR line-dried). The PUL is not de-laminating, and there are no stitching flaws. I have been extremely systematic at ensuring they fit my baby snugly properly, without allowing the inner gussets to be twisted or the liner to bunch up inside the shell.<br /><br />Despite my best attempts to prevent leaks, all 6 of my gogreen diapers systematically leak in the exact same way. The leak starts at the leg and the moisture is absorbed outward from the leg in all directions. The outer fabric of the diaper is always wet to the touch, which should not be the case for a &#34;waterproof&#34; fabric. Like my Gore-tex rain jacket, my other PUL diapers never feel wet to the touch because they do not absorb any moisture: they repel it. This is not the case with the outer fabric on my gogreen diapers. I thought at first my daughter was just too small and they did not fit properly, but she has gained six pounds, filled out substantially, and the leaks are still occurring in the exact same fashion.<br /><br />This moisture absorption by the outer fabric is a design flaw. No amount of proper care and usecan compensate for the improper material chosen to construct this diaper.",X_train

2854,the package arrived earlier than expected which was great because it was part of a gift for a baby shower that following weekend. The mother and father both loved it! however the packaging of the actual product was somewhat crude as if someone just threw two things they had no more further use for in a box and shipped it out. Made it seem like it was from ebay! that's the only reason I took off one star!,X_train
2855,The picture is not what you are going to receive.  I also received red white and blueberry.  It is really annoying because the fusion red and white is really hard to find so I was excited to pay a little extra to get what I wanted. I don't even want to go through the hassle of returning and waiting for my refund. Ughhhh. If I wanted the red white and blueberry I could have easily ordered it. I am def not satisfied.,X_train
2856,I finally broke down and bought this boppy total body pillow and I slept so great last night.  I used to put a pillow behind me and in front of me.  This is such a great pillow.

I've found tart cherries to be very beneficial for relieving my arthritis aches and pain and other inflammation-type problems. And the best thing about this product I think - no added sugar! No added chemicals or preservatives.,X_train
2870,"One would expect Amazon to be more careful especially during Valentine season. If someone orders a heart shaped box of candies (With minimal food/nutrition factor) the packaging needs to be of utmost quality - or atleast not messed beyond belief.

2879,"I bought this exact pack of Happy Fute diapers off Ebay 2 years ago and the diapers are still going strong. I have another pack of diapers I also bought off ebay under the name sun baby (or something like that) and they don't even compare to the quality of these ones and were practically the same price. The inserts are thick and very absorbent. I use two inserts at night and 99% of the time there are no leaks. During the day I find that one insert is sufficient. I am on here today because I'm pregnant and am buying the happy flute diapers once again for my next little one. The value and quality is just too good to pass up. I can have peace of mind knowing that my son (and next baby) isn't sitting in nasty chemical filled disposable diapers. Sure it takes a bit more effort on my part, but once I got my routine down I couldn't imagine diapering my children any other way!!!",X_train
2880,"This is a terribly designed product.  I am going to throw them out because:  1. the screws are so bad that two of the first three broke as I tried to use them, even though I was screwing into wood using a hand screwdriver.  They seem to be made of the softest metal imaginable.    2. It is quite difficult to install the other piece in exactly the right location so that they fit together well.  3. Even once I installed it with my own screws, the drawer could not close all the way.  I will use rubber bands instead and look for something better designed.",X_train

We will try a few more batches to see if we get use to the flavor.  We don't drink regular soda very often.  I usually drink seltzer water with a splash of lemon in it so soda drinking isn't really on our menu.  We thought we would try home brew soda because we like the idea that soda originated healthful \\""tonics\\"".  This made the batch of root beer taste medicinal.

I have found though that the k-cups tend to produce watery and bland coffee at best, which is why it was such a nice surprise to find these dark magic extra bold k-cups! These things actually taste like decent coffee and aren't watery or acidic. Thanks green mountain for an awesome product and for curing my morning zombie woes!

What's up with that Amazon?!   <br /> <br />The first two cans of this soup I've used so far were both more than a little dented, and the second one could really be considered dangerously so since it was very difficult to find a way to get it open (almost gave up on it).   <br /> <br />Get with it Amazon!

2902,"I bought this pillow because I was using so many pillows on my bed, they kept moving in the night when I would turn over and then I would have to start the process of getting comfy all over again. The first night I used this pillow, i felt I was supported all around! I am currently in my 20th week carrying twin boys, so Im already showing big time, and something to support my back and tummy was a must. I do use my memory foam pillow on top of this because I need to be elevated when i sleep otherwise I have trouble breathing at night! It doesn't hog the whole bed, so my husband can enjoy the bed too (on nights Im not snoring like a freight train! LOL) I thought that the exposed zipper would bug me because I didn't purchase a pillow case for it. It hasn't at all even touched me in the night, so no worries there. If I need the pillow in between my legs I can easily grab it. Also I know us prego's should sleep on our sides, but I was having issues of major cramping in my hip after a period of time sleeping on my side without the pillow. Since using the pillow, I still get the cramp at night, but I can enjoy a longer sleep than before. I usually just turn over and sleep on the other side. I love the all around support, I can turn over and not have issues of moving the pillow into a certain place, cause its already there!. I am sure i will continue to use this pillow even after my pregnancy is over with. I will be have a scheduled c-section, so I do hope this pillow can be used to help in support of my recovery as well. I know the price is higher than most pillows, but totally worth it! Even the pillow itself is very plush with that not too firm, not too flimsy feel and the fabric used around the pillow is pretty nice too. I'd recommend this pillow to pregnant women or anyone that needs all around support of your body!",X_train

2921,"Although this bulk two-pack of 34.5 ounce bags of Quaker Natural Granola Cereal can be considered slightly overpriced, by comparison, it's still less expensive than the standard-sized retail package.  So long as Costco no longer carries this exact same product, then you won't be able to find it cheaper anywhere else.  That's where I first became addicted to this granola and have since tried many sub-par substitutes when Costco decided to discontinue my go-to favorite.<br /><br />The cereal has just the right amount of sweetness and crunch without being too hard in texture like Kashi's break-your-teeth-but-stay-lean Crunch.  Surprisingly, a 1/2 cup serving contains only 5g of fat.  The high fiber as well as the protein from the almonds definitely helps to keep the appetite satiated until lunchtime.  As for the flavor, it can be described as a delicate blend of coconut, honey, raisins, and oats.",X_train
2922,Let me just say to all the people looking to buy this candy that most of them ARE NOT FIZZY. Maybe one or two are like the energy drink ones but not all of them. Also the bag of candy you get will more than likely not the bag in the item description pictures. There are many different variations of this mix of candies so you will more than likely get something else than what is pictured. So with all that being said this is a wonderful candy to buy if you are looking for something new to try. All the flavours are interesting and fun and like me I'm sure you'll enjoy them too.,X_train

Only negative I have about this oil is I cook on a Viking cooktop with a downdraft (that's a story for another days) but I live in Maine where the temps can drop to -20 degrees in winter and my downdraft has some cold air blowback so guess what happens with oil splatters on the downdraft?  They get solid!  Always a fun job to clean off, but easy enough using Awesome Degreaser spray and a few paper towels.

I read some of the reviews and wish to agree that the only downfall of the chair is it is not convenient to take the baby out by sliding the tray out. HOWEVER, this chair reclines in three different levels and that is how I take my son out. It's easy to do (A big red handle near the top, that you pull up to recline the seat ) I haven't needed to remove the table top except for cleaning it. The diswasher tray is holding up after a hundred washes! My 17 month old still plays with the removable toy since now he can push the bigger buttons for the bubbles and twirling around the fish. When he was 6 months he listened to the music from the removable toy and loved to chew on the side bar toys. At least this allowed to get some of my chores finished. It is very easy to clean and wash. It does do well to fold up and travel. I do recommend this to all moms!",X_train

2937,"We bought an 80 count box of this coffee when another popular brand increased their price by about $20.  First observation was that the k-cups were physically lighter than other k-cups I've come across.  Second observation backed up my first observation, which was that the coffee was very weak looking and there was very little resistance as the water was passing through the k-cup.  Ever notice that some k-cups brew faster than others?  That's because they're using less coffee in their k-cups - lame.  End result was a cup of bitter water that tasted like it had been messed with to increase the caffeine content.  Only way to get bold coffee out of these k-cups is to use the smallest cup setting and use three or four of these k-cups, in which case the end result is only marginally better and I wasted more money on my cup of coffee.  I tried so hard to get through that 80 count box... I really did.  I just got fed up with ruining my morning routine by drinking this stuff.

During the day, I set this up in my office and then come evening, move into the family room. It's fairly easy to collapse, transport and reset up-the only tip is to make sure to slightly losen the screws at the hinges to make it easier to fold-then retighten when it's all set up. Also, w/the expansion, the &#34;handle&#34; that's used to secure the standard play yard doesn't fit now-but that's what bungee cords are for",X_train

I take it all back.<br /><br />I really find this one of my favorite instant coffees. Now instant is not going to be as good a fresh perked, I know. But for instant, this is pretty good!<br /><br />First, it easily dissolves into a smooth coffee, without bits of the instant as clumps (which happens with Taster's Choice). It looks nicer, but I can't help but think that it also makes its taste smoother.<br /><br />Second, the taste is, in fact, smoother than other instants that I have tried. A nice rich taste.<br /><br />All in all, this is my favorite instant coffee to this point. . . .",X_train

2954,"While I haven't tried 'every' raw cacao powder on the market (who could?), I've tried many, some of which were of good quality and others not so.    The Organic Nectars Premium Raw Cacao Powder is the best I've tried yet and I'm very pleased with it.  It has a very fine consistency that mixes extremely well with hot water and just a bit of stirring.  The taste is quite chocolate-y and smooth, being both clean-tasting and rich, to paraphrase another pleased reviewer.  I generally throw in just a touch of chile pepper, cinnamon and a natural sweetener and the result is a delicious drink that gives me all that I expect from a quality raw cacao powder.    \\""Two thumbs up!\\"" is obviously my assessment of this product.  If you enjoy true cacao powder and are looking for a premium product and taste, I say give the Organic Nectars powder a try.  Based upon my experience, my strong bet is that you will like it as much as I do.",X_train

2956,"So instant noodles aren't healthy for you, we know that. Get over it.<br /><br />Nongshim currently is my favorite, TRULY instant noodles. Cup Noodles, while infinitely cheaper, does not have the taste and the deceptively low-sodium feel to it as Nongshim does. Don't get me wrong, sodium will always be an issue with these soup bases, but at least the packet inside will allow you to decide how dense the flavor you want it to be.<br /><br />I use a water heater with water at 195-205 degrees, and in 3-4 minutes my noodles are set to be eaten. You can fluff it up by adding a fried egg, meats, veggies, etc. But if you're like me and only use them for emergencies when you have zero time to cook, four minutes is all that's necessary.",X_train

Just another company making us think it is ok for our children when it really is not.

2960,"Not only is this swaddler harder to put on (takes longer than the Velcro kinds because you have to loop additional fabric over each arm and under their back) but my 3 month old was able to wiggle her arms out of it even when I have snuggly wrapped her in it! For all that hassle of exfra fabric (which annoys her while putting it on) I still end up with a baby waking herself up by her hands touching her face! I'm going to see if making the \\""arm loops\\"" less loose helps though the directions say to make it loose around their arms, I may have to do it tighter? Just to let you know if you're also having this issue. If she couldn't get out, this would be a 4 star product due to the hassle nd length of time it takes to put on.   The only pro this has over other swaddlers is that it doesn't have that loud sound of Velcro every time you put it on and take it off.  Also, I couldn't find this product in an organic fabric. If the company is reading this, I would love an organic option. Thanks! ;)",X_train
2961,"I LOVE PB2. It is versatile, low calorie, and delicious. It's great on its own, with fruit, and as a thickener/sweetner for smoothies and baking. It doesn't have an overwhelming peanutty taste in small ammounts so I've even seen it used in savory recipes for things like crab cakes and sauces. That said, I far prefer the chocolate flavor. It doesn't taste super chocolatey and I find the regular flavor a bit bland.",X_train

The patterns they have are great but it would be really nice if they had more colors to choose from, they don't even have green which is a basic color I think. We haven't had any leaks although we've only had it for about a week and my son has only leek twice since we;ve been using cloth (much much more often in disposable!) it is slightly harder to get on because of the way the snaps are positioned on the diaper but overall I really like the diaper a lot. I wish the owl pattern was available on Amazon Prime shipping though.",X_train

2979,"Fits my doggie Jogger/stroller perfectly!! I love it! am able to securely hold 2 large Starbucks plastic reusable cups OR 2 large Sport bottle style water bottles. The material is fantastic, in that, it actually is as if the cups/bottles are in there own cookie's to keep them cold. I can keep my keys and dog treats, or running aids like Gu, or gels, in the center pocket that magnetically closes and on top of the closure is a zippered pocket that would fit individual keys or ID's, or credit cards, etc. I LOVE the removable pouch (by zipper) on the front that fits my iPhone 6+ with room to spare. It definitely could easily become my purse to run in and out of stores with room to fit all that I normally would keep inside a purse. There is also a great mesh netting large pocket that hangs from the caddy down the back side of the stroller that zips up in the middle. It's perfect for those smaller bags that you have to store while shopping in the mall or at outlets, etc. There is a smaller mesh pocket next to the removable pouch, that could fit the average sized cell phone. This is my second stroller caddy for this stroller, and THIS one by far is working out much better than the first. more storage and the fact that it holds large cups and water bottles securely is a huge benefit to those that use running/jogging strollers.

2981,"Because I enjoy a large mug of robust, fresh coffee to begin my day at home, I usually freshly-grind my 100% Colombian arabica beans immediately before brewing my morning pot.  However, when I travel in my RV, I don't take my burr grinder with me.  Therefore I try to duplicate the fresh-ground taste with pre-ground coffee while on the road.  I have been successful with only one other brand, which is pricey, so I decided to give Community Coffee a try.<br /><br />That this coffee is produced from 100% arabica beans in Louisiana was, in my opinion, a good start.  My brews of this coffee have given me similar robust flavor as I get from my beans without bitterness or what I deem to be an \\""acidy\\"" taste from Starbucks coffee.  The advertised cost per pound of this coffee from Amazon is similar to what I pay for my coffee beans, but less than I've been paying for another brand of pre-ground coffee that I've been brewing.<br /><br />The reason that I've given this coffee only four stars is that, to get the same strength I usually enjoy, I must use a rounded coffee scoop (nearly two tablespoons) to get the same strength that I get from my other brand with a level scoop.  Apparently recognizing this strength issue, the producer of this coffee recommends using two tablespoons to brew each six-ounce cup.  Although I haven't done the precise math, it would seem that having to use more ground coffee to get the same results negates some of the price advantage that this coffee offers over the more expensive coffee I've been using.<br /><br />Nonetheless, after making adjustments for strength, I've been able to brew some very tasty, satisfying cups of coffee with this brand.  If you choose to try this coffee, you may wish to experiment with the amount that you use to achieve maximum satisfaction.",X_train

I was careful while grilling to be sure they didn't get dried out. I used a pound of grass fed 85/15 beef to four pounds of bison as well to help prevent drying out. The only seasoning I used - none. I let the flavor of the meat do its thing. Nobody in our group had ever had bison and everyone was raving about how good it was.<br /><br />I used a pound in a batch of chili and it was just as good in there.

This saved me from running to all the bathrooms anywhere we may be at the time.  I also used to have to pull over when driving so he could potty.  It really saved my little guy from peeing his pants and being ashamed or embarrassed for something that wasn't his fault.  It's small enough to fit in the stroller basket and it has 2 pockets for storage. (gallon zip lock baggies & wipes)  After each use, I wipe the potty clean and throw all the waste away.  I SEARCHED for this and was soooo happy they still sold this somewhere!  Thank you Amazon!  GREAT PRODUCT!!  PLEASE don't ever stop selling this!",X_train
3027,"First of all, I LOVE the taste of Cafe Bustello coffees.  I am diabetic, so when I saw the cappuccino  at my local Torino's supermarket in New Rochelle, NY, I decided to try it,  I liked it so much, I would buy a box every time I went shopping.  Then Torino's stopped restocking the sugar free style. I spoke to several people at the store.  They never got it back.  I enjoy a cup or two in the afternoons about 3:00 for a pick me up.  It tastes like a rich dessert,  When I saw Bustello's online, I decided to order it that way.  Thank you for the availability of on line ordering.  I never have to miss  my cappuccino!",X_train

3032,"I was researching on this tea for a while. I've been drinking it for a while too. But as a cautious consumer, I also like to know about the potential risk factor that came along with it. Dr Weil isn't sure about the long term benefit of this tea drinking daily and he has written that there are further research to be published. Various studies published in the journal Epidemiology in 1994 concluded that drinking yerba mate regularly increased a person's risk of respiratory or digestive cancers(Lung and esophagus cancer)  by 60%. It seems like too much of everything is not good after all. They've suggested that even though it has it's benefits, it equally poses higher risk to those suffering already from diseases.

It looked so darn comfy in the pics that I had to give it a try. I admit that when I first unrolled it out of its tiny packaging, I was intimidated. I read the book, looked at the pictures and tried to mimic such positions as the \\""hug hold\\"" and \\""kangaroo\\"" with not much luck. This wrap was clumsy, way too long, and hard for one person to put it on. Yes, this is a positive review and I told you that I loved it so...then I figured out that because it is the perfect length and width of fabric you can make up your own positions and \\""tie\\"" your baby into place however you want them! I learned this after my 2 week old DD went to sleep in an upright position on my chest. I eyed the Moby and wrapped her in place immediately. Sure, it was clumsy at first and I didn't know where to tug and tuck all of the fabric, but that was the beauty of it! The fabric has just the right amount of give and is not too slippery and is breatheable. By the third try I had Moby in my command and I have wrapped my DD to me in all sorts of crazy positions. On my chest, on my side, and even while she was breastfeeding one time. LOVE THIS WRAP!",X_train

Although this bottle isn't a big ticket item, everything is relative, and the cost for this particular bottle is waaaaaaaaaaaay overpriced. I bought it because mommies here are raving about how the baby takes to this bottle and then never needs their bottle again, and how this thing is a great way to wean the baby off of the bottle. I just don't think think so.. it wasn't my experience at all. My baby can take or leave this bottle. She's 17 mos old and would much rather have her normal bottle over this one any day. She loves the picture but you can buy a bottle for half the price with a much better picture without having to look to far.

I prefer this pump to the electric because A. it's actually very quick, 5 minutes to fill 4 oz after let down and B. it's less painful than an electric since I get to control it with my hand.  The only thing I would recommend is that you buy two so that you don't have to wash the parts when on long trips where you may need to pump more than once.

From that standpoint, this pack fits its billing.<br /><br />The dimensions listed (9 x 7 x 2 inches) are mostly accurate, except that the pack is slightly hump shaped, so the two-inch interior depth tapers down towards the top.<br /><br />For an 14 to 18 month old who wants to help, this pack would be perfect: padded \\""just right\\"" on the straps and back, quality materials and durable construction to survive a little rough handling and dragging, plus the leash...<br /><br />However, for our 34 inch tall, 30 pound, not-quite 2½ year-old, it was obviously too small as soon as we opened the package.<br /><br />What will the Littlelife hold? We were hoping he could carry his knit nap blanket in it, but it's necessary to literally stuff it in (the blanket is about 2x3 feet).  Two or three board books, or a small lunch, or a hat and a pullover all are about the ideal sized load. And actually, that's not bad for day-tripping. But is it smaller than a bread box? Definitely -- it's too small to hold an average sized loaf of bread (cut me some slack -- trying to think of some common frame of reference).<br /><br />I'll next try a [[ASIN:B004N8C0RG Wildkin Pack 'n Snack Backpack]], which has roughly twice the capacity.

The vendor offered them at a reasonable price. I'm sure they could be broken, but the arms are tough plastic. When installing don't use a drill bit too large for the screws, otherwise they won't fasten securely. By adjusting the mounting screw tightness, they can either rotate easily or require firm pressure to move. The detent notches in the mounting hardware locks the arms in position - a nice touch.

However if you are looking to purchase this item, then take into consideration my review before you pull the trigger.<br /><br />According to my research, I had a choice between Solo & Ekobrew.  At the time of purchase, I saw that the Ekobrew seemed more favorable and that is the reason for my purchase. Now that I actually own two of these and have used them, I am going to stick with this brand just because I'm used to it. If you really want to know the differences, you can scroll down to some of the helpful reviews and that would dissect the differences between Ekobrew & Solo.<br /><br />The obvious advantages to this product are that it reduces waste and it saves money.  But with those advantages aside, I purchased it mainly so we (my wife and I) could use up our supply of ground coffee that haven't been used for several months.  You see, we used to have a traditional coffee maker but I don't drink coffee that often and my wife only drinks 1 cup in the morning.  Since we got a Keurig for our wedding, those bags haven't seen the light of day.  Yes I know you can scoop/brew a certain amount and store the rest away but since having had Keurig, that has become too much of a hassle. The Keurig has introduced laziness to our daily routine.<br /><br />With the Ekobrew, you reintroduce \\""work\\"" to your coffee routine (measuring, filling, emptying, rinsing) but it's much less effort than that of traditional coffee machine. In fact, once you get the hang of it, it really doesn't add but a couple minutes to your morning coffee routine. Plus it at least gives us a reason to use up those bags of coffee (especially the ones we got from the Dominican Republic during our honeymoon) and save us money.<br /><br />With that, I recommend this product.",X_train
3106,"I suppose I should have figured this bar would be crunchy considering this is the Nut Delight variety but I didn't expect this much crunch! Crunch factor similar to Gobstopper hard candy (I think it is the syrup that holds the nuts together that makes it so hard). There was also a type of nut that is included in the mix that I did not care for, (not sure which one). If you like exotic nuts and are looking for a snack that is super crunchy than this is for you. Unfortunately, it did not suit me. On the up side, it is a good source of protein and antioxidents.",X_train

He must've had a few Jalape&ntilde;o's, or some Mexican food before eating these, because they don't put off any heat at all.  They do however do everything else others say they do!<br /><br />I really purchased these bad boys to give to a few CHOICE &#34;Friends&#34;, and some fellow Co-workers!!  I handed these little guys out like they grew from a tree!  I made sure not to give them any more than 15.  If you give someone a handful of 30 or more, they may eat only 5 or 10 of them, and save the rest for later.  If you give them 15, they are practically guaranteed to eat all 15!  So, after handing them out, I sat down at my desk and waited!! ;)  These little devils got hold of my co-workers after 45 minutes to an hour and a half, and I have to tell you, I've never had so much fun at work before!  There are 5 restrooms in my entire building.  There are about 60 people in the building.  1 co-ed restroom, and 2 male/ 2 female restrooms.  There was a line of people using the restrooms, even after the guys decided that it was ok to use the female restrooms for EMERGENCY use only!!<br /><br />BELIEVE ME, THIS WAS AN EMERGENCY!!<br /><br />My Boss decided he couldn't wait in line, and took off at 10:00 for an early lunch, just so he could use a restroom I think!  Let me just say, we have flexible lunch schedules, although we typically limit them to about an hour.  He didn't come back until 2:30, and he was not happy!  He asked me what I gave him, and I told him that I had just received the package from Amazon (I showed him the box), I showed him that they were Sugar Free Gummy Bears!  I asked him if he liked them.  He said he thought he had a bad reaction to them, but I told him I doubted it, since I ate several myself, and nothing happened.  (((I hadn't eaten ANY - Im so EVIL!!!))  I was in for it though, after he talked to several other people that had the same reaction!  They all came into my office at the same time, and confronted me about the gummy bear incident!  I thought for sure they were going to shove a handful down my throat to see if I had the same reaction, but gladly they didn't!!  I have to say I was a bit worried!  They all came to the same conclusion, that the gummies were evil, and that they needed to be destroyed!!  They took them from me, (even after some pleading from me) and destroyed them!  By destroying them, I mean of course that they flushed them down the toilet, to send them to the horrible place that had just claimed 4 days worth of bowel movements from each person!!!<br /><br />So, after going through only about 10% of a 1 lb bag, I have to say it was worth every bit!!  Needless to say, I have now ordered a 5 lb bag, so I can give them to my &#34;Choice&#34; friends, (seeing as I wasn't quite able to distribute them after the first incident) and post another fun bit in the 5 lb section!  :)<br /><br />If you are looking to eat these as treats, take my word for it and just buy the regular sugar gummies.

3121,"I purchased this monitor about a year ago after reading good reviews here and deciding it was the best for our budget.  It has been a great monitor.  The picture is very clear, infrared works well and the sound is good.  The beeping noise it makes when out of signal or charge is really loud and can be annoying, but I always hear it (which I guess is the point).  It's simple to operate and has no unnecessary bells and whistles.<br /><br />About two weeks ago I started having issues with the battery not charging.  The connector for the charging cable seemed faulty so I replaced that, but the unit still wouldn't hold a charge.  I contacted customer service through email and received a reply back in less than 24 hours.  They had me run a few tests, then offered to replace my unit (even though it was a couple of weeks out of warranty).  The response time was great and the customer service representatives were very friendly and helpful.  I have a new unit now that is working great and plan to buy another camera for baby #2 in the coming months.<br /><br />Thanks, Infant Optics, for a great product and great service.",X_train
3122,"After thoroughly researching our baby monitor options, we selected the Infant Optics DXR-8 based on features, price, and customer service reviews. The monitor works great- I like the different zoom lens options, night-vision and temperature reading. We have the camera mounted on the wall, and it works out great. The motor in the camera is quiet, and you can pan around the room without waking the baby. We have no complaints about the reception capability, as we have a big house with tall ceilings, and we are able to get reception in the baby's room when on the lower level of the opposite side of the house. Occasionally we will lose reception, but it is rare, brief and not unique to the Infant Optics monitor- as it occurs with a back-up monitor system we have as well. We had a small issue with the port in which the monitor gets plugged into for charging, and in less than a week the issue was resolved and we were good to go. The customer service for this product is fantastic, and that trumps all of its other features. So many monitors out there have similar features and capabilities, but what you really need is a company that will stand by their product in the event that something happens, especially for how much video monitoring systems cost. The Infant Optics customer service is responsive and effective, and seems genuinely concerned about the satisfaction of their customers. I would definitely purchase this monitor again, and would recommend it to others.  UPDATE: This baby monitor is made extremely poorly. Typically I don't bother to edit reviews, but the exasperation I have felt from dealing with one faulty monitor after another, along with seemingly confusing correspondences from the company (which makes me wonder if they are actually reading my emails and concerns), I feel compelled to edit this review. We have had to replace our monitor 3 times (thanks to an extended warranty provided by the company), because the port that plugs the monitor into the charger keeps breaking. Yes, it is nice the company would replace it, but our first one broke after months of using it. I suspect the company knows how poorly made these things are.  The monitor indeed has some nice features, but no amount of features can make up for the time, return costs, and hassle that comes with constantly replacing the monitor because it can't withstand daily use. We have since purchased a new monitor from a different manufacturer, and when you take into account the $219 we spent on this monitor in April, 2014, that's $500+ in baby monitors alone. If you have that kind of money, time and energy to waste with a monitor, than this monitor is for you. If you don't, then chose something else.",X_train

3126,"This is a fantastic product, I just ordered my second tub.  The seeds smell very fresh and keep well.  The protein is primarily edestin, which is a native protein to the human being and is the ideal protein for anti-body and immunoglobulin production.  There are also no enzyme inhibitors on shelled cannabis which makes it very easily digestible.  Also,  the fat content is literally a perfect source of essential fats, with the same ratio of fats as are found in our brain!  Of course they are short chain omega 3 fatty acids, as with all vegetarian fair, however the human body produces the enzyme delta-9 desaturase which transform them into long chain fatty acids, like those found in fish.  It is this process of the human being developing the long chain fats that Rudolf Steiner hints at as being one of the real spiritual reasons to consume vegetarian foods, is that our body becomes a factory for certain fats, which has a certain alchemical effect within the individual.       I thought it would take me awhile to go through these but I finished the tub within 2 weeks.  Excellent to sprinkle on salads, steamed veggies, base in smoothies, additive to yogurts and oatmeals, mixed with potatoes, pretty much mix it with anything.    I was showing the tub off to one of my friends who eats more of a mainstream diet and I put it up to her nose to smell it and she said it smelled like dirt - it really sort of does, it smells great.  It is very earthy and almost bitter in taste, however it is very mild when mixed with other things.  The seeds have a robust character of tremendous value to the human species, anyone committed to the development and future of humanity would be wise to befriend and defend this plant of nearly unequivocal value to the human species.    Hopefully there will be hemp farms in America soon - If we had eyes to see this food would be a staple in all hosptials, schools, and other major food institutions.  The plant is easy to grow and extremely useful in a multitude of ways.  Word to the wise: Keep your eye on hemp.",X_train

We also got one with two slots, but find that we often give her three foods at a time, so prefer this dish.  We feed her from it still, she doesn't use it, so I can't comment on the training rim.  If you wash it right away and don't microwave to high temps it cleans out well, though if you make a mistake and overheat carrots, say, it can stain the plastic, which dropped it a half star for me.  Otherwise, it cleans up easily and you can use it for low temp microwave heating no problem (I like 20 seconds at power level 40%).<br /><br />I also don't really like the icons showing meat and veggy and some attempt to tell me what a &#34;balanced meal&#34; should look like based on the partition sizes however.  I wish they'd just left the sections blank and let me decide what to feed the baby and in what proportions.  I dropped them a half star for this as well.  I prefer simplicity and don't want to have to see the little chicken icon every time I feed the baby vegetables in that slot.  That said, the three sizes are useful since there's probably one item you will have more of as the main meal, then two side dishes for variety.  We will do a meal like puree salmon, peas, and applesauce.

She pulls them right up at the beginning of every bath and now uses them as bath &#34;appliques&#34; for the side of the tub.  She loves to pull them off and on.  I've tried to buy the Boon bath appliques that are intended for this purpose and she likes those, but still pulls up her little whales from the bottom of the tub.  I'm still glad I got these all rubber, non-PVC tiny mats.  By the way, they are about 5&#34; by 3&#34; each.  Hopefully she'll start to lose interest in pulling these up soon.",X_train

I really didn't know what to expect before purchasing; However being a Naturopathic Medicine Doctor, I am always looking for products that truly work as well as recommend to my patients. I believe the best way to recommend something to others is to first use it yourself. Well, not only did I use it on myself, before using it on my children, but I also gave it to my husband for headache relief and I gave him a little more than prescribed on the bottle. It worked great without causing sluggishness or sleepiness. I gave it to my kids as directed and it still gave fast relief.",X_train

3176,"I bought this carrier for the moderate-very cold winters in Philadelphia.  It fit our carrier perfectly and seems to be high quality.  I like that it's not overly padded since I can control my baby's temperature based on what kind of blanket I put inside with him.  We have used this in autumn with no blanket beneath and when it got bitterly cold I put a more substantial blanket inside.  If you live in a frozen tundra you may want a heftier cover, but this should really do well for most moderate-very cold winter climates.<br /><br />The fabric does not look cheap to me (as another reviewer mentioned). I really like the color scheme and the plaid detail.  I also love that the flap velcros both closed and open.  I have had many people ask where I got it since using it.<br /><br />This works well for us and doesn't cost a ridiculous amount.  Perfect!",X_train

When it's attached to a table, it is sturdy and allow the sitting infant to be close enought to be fed from the table. <br /> <br />It requires a sturdy table (rounded or square)and that the child be able to sit easily and meet the weght requirements.

About the size of a finger.<br /><br />The con kills me because I bought this for introducing solid foods and for frozen soft food and breast milk (for teething purposes) but neither fit in this. So I can out frozen peas in there or small miniature chunks of ice. It's not that practical in all reality. I wouldn't buy it again.,X_train

3219,"I have been using this cushion for two months.  I had seen another mom using it, and I thought it was a great idea.  After using it for a while, I wish that I had shopped around and tested other cushions.  I think an item like this is a good idea, and I like mine when it's positioned correctly.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, the cushion rotates so that the side without cushioning is on the top, so it requires constant repositioning.  If in the correct position, it does have enough cushion to help aleviate the arm pain from carrying the carseat, but it seems that it is more likely to be rotated the wrong way, meaning that the cushion is unusable unless you reposition it.  A note on repositioning: I find that trying to rotate it back is only marginally effective, and usually I end up undoing the velcro and fastening it correctly again, only for it to rotate back to the wrong way after carrying the carseat from the house to the car.  (Yes, it has these little gripper dots on the inside that supposedly grip the carseat handle and try to prevent rotation, but they don't really work.)  The rotating is just frustrating!",X_train

3231,"This was a great purchase for us! It is perfect for our family. We don't really have the room to set up a high chair in our dining room, but we have a big enough table to add this onto. It is light and easy to assemble. I was able to mainly do it without directions (I did have to check one thing). And it is sturdier than I gave it credit for. baby girl bounces around and I don't worry one bit. She sits at the table with us this way, & she seems to like that set up as opposed to being off to the side. We like it too. And the &#34;cushion&#34; comes out to wash so that helps a lot as well.<br /><br />My only complaint,  although small, is that this wasn't necessarily made for tables that have that nice sized decorative under lip like ours does, so it was a bit of a effort to set up to get the arms underneath that lip so ut sets up correctly. But it really only added a couple of minutes, nothing major.<br /><br />Overall I am quite pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE: After over quite literally a year of daily use, I can easily say I am very pleased with this chair's performance. The padded inner lining has not made the final cut, however, as it has given out. BUT, that took several washes in order to finally be put out of commission, and the baby is quite comfortable in the chair at mealtimes without it, so it was no huge loss overall. My little girl is getting bigger now, and is reaching the point in toddlerhood where a booster seat is more in order. That is the only reason we will be taking this down. So, if you need an extra seat to take with you, this is most definitely the one, because it more than passed the test",X_train

I was happy with the sling for a short while but then my baby squirmed too much for it and was half out of it most of the time. I decided to take the insert out and just use the infant position for my baby. However she wriggles and ends up with the wedge at the bottom of the ramp sticking into her back. If  your baby stays completely still for their bath then great but one little kick and my baby's bottom is no longer in the dip where it should be. I have to continually scoot her up to a sitting position so she doesn't hurt her back. Yes the newborn sling is a help but the rest of the tub is useless. Very disappointed.,X_train

3262,"I fell in love with Garrett's cheese popcorn over the summer and have since been looking for any reasonably-priced gourmet alternative that might be similar in taste. The first thing you should know is that Mike's tastes absolutely nothing like Garrett's.<br /><br />It may not have been what I was looking for but it's unfair to judge it for what it isn't, so how does it stack up objectively? Well for starters, I disagree with the occasional claim that it has no flavor- on the contrary, I felt that the flavor was sharp and strong. In fact, that's the main reason why it's not the popcorn for me. One of the reviews mentioned an overpowering coconut taste, and it's true that coconut is the first ingredient. I'm not sure if that's quite what I thought I was tasting, but whatever it was is definitely the main flavor. The popcorn is cheesy, definitely orange finger cheesy, but it doesn't quite TASTE like cheese. The other ingredients come together to create something of an exotic kind of tangy flavor that I wasn't expecting and didn't find altogether pleasant.<br /><br />The bag was tightly sealed and the popcorn itself was fresh and crisp, and there wasn't an overabundance of hulls or crumbs. The quality seems perfectly fine, I just couldn't finish the bag because of the strong flavor. If you've ever been to an inexpensive grocery store and grabbed a relatively unknown brand of air-popped cheese popcorn then you're probably familiar with the weird \\""cheddar but not really cheddar\\"" taste- that's the first thing that this reminded me of.<br /><br />The popcorn doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't have the creamy cheddary flavor that I look for in a gourmet cheese popcorn. Try it if you're an open-minded popcorn fan in the mood for something a little different.",X_train

Shared the chocolate bunny to see if the candy is liked by hubby and my sons, so far so good, we will order again. The candy came in , in perfect condition, very nicely wrapped.",X_train
3267,These are very helpful for small babies.  Especially babies that can't hold their head up on their own or when they fall asleep.  My baby is 3 months old and she can fall asleep and her head is supported very well.  Thank You for such a wonderful product and they are the cutest little accent to brighten up a baby's carseat.  They also save the neck from getting rubbed by the carseat straps.,X_train
3268,"This was my \\""big\\"" item on my registry, and no one bought it, which I expected. We, however, took the plunge and purchased it. I could not be happier. I run with it all the time, and I love it! No complaints. It fits in our tiny Honda. I pull it out with HUGE child in arms. I can't complain. My son is now 19 months, and this is the only stroller we ever bought. We might buy a cheap umbrella stroller for the summer- this is a little big for carnivals, etc. We are also now considering buying the double, since we are expecting number 2! This is a great product. I highly recommend it.",X_train
3269,"These do a very good job, they are also a bit cheaper than many other brands out there.  They exactly what they claim to be.  But I will say they do an excellent job.<br />Our child has never been able to remove one of them and to be honest I don't expect she will anytime soon, as they are kind of a pain for us to remove.  In truth if I have cut my fingernails recently they are almost too hard for me to remove.  Which in my opinion is probably a good thing for keeping little fingers out of outlets.",X_train

These chips are spendy, but for us, they were worth it.",X_train
3276,"I much prefer the taste of these to most energy drinks, and the fact that they're carbonated. They're pretty much sodas with some extra caffeine added in. The names of the different flavors are somewhat misleading, though. The almond flavor tastes more like a lemon or ginger ale. And the citrus punch likes like a grapefruit soda. Apparently some people don't like that taste? If you like to eat grapefruit, you will like it. The ginger crush is the one I least prefer, it just tastes like fruit juice.",X_train

3312,"I am a self-confessed bread lover but I have never tried and Gluten-free alternatives, so naturally I was curious how they compare.<br /><br />For the record, I am not on a gluten-free or Paleo diet, but that didn't stop me from buying a variety of gluten-free 'Paleo' food to satisfy my curiosity regarding the taste. And this intriguing loaf was one of my choices.<br /><br />The loaf looks like a perfectly normal loaf of bread, and as an added bonus, is low in carbohydraytes, which is useful if you eat a lot of bread like me.<br /><br />I wasted no time in smearing two slices with strawberry jam for a simple test sandwich. And to my delight, it was delicious! Of course it lacks a certain flavour that only 'real' bread can provide, but I would even go as far as saying that this bread is better than some normal bread complete with gluten.<br /><br />The only minor niggle for me is that you must store the bread a the fridge (unlike normal bread) otherwise it will go stale at record speed.<br /><br />For people on a Gluten free diet real wheat bread is out of the question. But this loaf is a perfect alternative, you can use it for sandwiches and toast while still sticking to a strict Paleo or gluten-free regimen. But for a regular bread-eater like myself this is actually pretty tasty.<br /><br />I would recommend that you ignore the overly-negative reviews and try it for yourself, you will most likely be pleasantly surprised!",X_train

We ended up using the Tommie tippee adapter to use those nipples -- which seems to be working OK.,X_train

It is something to get accustomed to but once you have this powerful stuff in a little can for over a week, it'll be hard to go back to those over caffeinated \\""energy\\"" drinks. Well worth the money you pay and much more healthier for you as well.   If you don't have the time or patience to brew your own tea, this is one of the greatest drinks for those on the go.    If you do have time to brew, I recommend buying the 100 pack Matcha green tea box from Costco, it is from ItoEn as well.    If you feel that its too bitter, try it with some pellegrino or perrier mixed with lemon or whatever fruit you like to add that splash of flavor.     You won't regret purchasing unless you are those people that got some dented cans in their case.    Enjoy and cheers!",X_train
3329,"It makes great coffee, but using this filter can burn you.    The directions tell you to pour hot water in the top, then reach in with your fingers and unscrew the (now) boiling hot metal plate.  Other models have a slot so you can use a screwdriver.  The best don't use screws at all.  Try finding one of them before you buy this one.",X_train
3330,"Love this!  I've got 9 month old twins.  I'm looking for another soother as good as this one, so I can swap them from one crib to another (just to keep it interesting for them), but so far can't find one that does what this does.   I like that the music is soothing, not loud or annoying like some other toys.  The colored panels behind each animal light up as the music plays (again, not too bright or fast).  When the babies were younger, they drawn to just watch it and listen.  Now that they are much more active, they really enjoy playing with the interactive parts of the animals.  The lions mane rotates, the monkey slides up and down, the gator clicks back and forth, and the ball in the flower spins with small balls inside.  They have yet to get bored with it, and it entertains them if they are not quite ready to sleep, or just woke up and are looking for something to do.  Now that they can sit, they enjoy playing with it from a new angle/height where they can more easily reach the animals.    The only thing I would change is to have the piano keys play individual notes.  You can hit them individually, but this just starts the music and lights.  I would also like to see a setting that plays a longer run of music.  As it is, though, it is long enough to get them relaxed, and now they can hit it to start it again if they want.  Overall, I still give it 5 stars, especially considering the price!    I like some of the other soothers out there, but they are not interactive like this one.  Too bad, as it would be a simple thing to just add some moving parts to what are otherwise really neat toys to watch and listen to.       For now, one twin gets this toy, and the other gets a cute mirror and whatever other toys I dangle from the rail.  If anyone knows of another as good as this one, let me know!",X_train

Very much too bad, because this salsa is my favorite food item at the moment, so I'd easily be going through a box a week if I began ordering them.

The gate held up, but I was worried the kids would eventually break through.

3348,"After doing a lot of research I found that there aren't a lot of reviews out there for this stroller so I thought I would help in explaining how wonderful this stroller is! :)    We had a chance to use our stroller for the first time this past weekend.  I have to say that I am VERY impressed with the maneuverability, style, and the look of this stroller.  It was very easy to assemble; it literally took 5 mins.  It did take a few try's to close it but once you figure it out it's a cinch!  Keep in mind that when it does close it is still bulky (very similar to your standard stroller - definitely not your umbrella stroller) so those with small cars this might not be the stroller for you.  We have an SUV so we don't mind.  The basket on this stroller is HUGE and is easy to access from either side regardless of how the seat facing, has a very nice cup holder and the canopy is absolutely amazing.  You can't get any bigger than this to shield your baby from the wind, rain, etc.  Yes, there is no \\""parent tray\\"" on this stroller but there is a pocket on the back of the seat so you can store your keys, phone or whatever and it's out of the way.  I am so glad we got this to replace our Chicco stroller (which we absolutely hate).  Once our baby was able to sit up we didn't like that we couldn't see and interact with her; with the Mia Moda you have the option and that is a BIG + for us.  There is nothing bad I can say about this stroller.  Overall, we are very glad we bought this stroller and would recommend to anyone!    PS: the video that someone provided as a review is awesome!

I was hoping this would be a cost effective way get my bubble tea fix but if I keep this up I'll be paying FAR more than if I went to the store regularly. Do NOT believe that this is enough to make 30+ drinks. Also, the kit comes with 5 cups, 5 lids and 5 Boba straws. For a kit this expencive I would have expected better quality cups and straws. I will need to wash the cheap plastic cups and straws if I want to continue with this kits. It's just not feasible. I will not be buying this kit again. Doing the math, I now realize that buying the ingredients separately from a different vender is a FAR better way to go. The only reason it got 2 stars is because the powders are delicious and everything came undamaged and in a relatively appropriate time. Also, I never received a tracking number at any point which I wasn't a fan of.  I just feel misled and ripped off.",X_train

Dry fit them in the closed position so that the rubber door protector just closes on the door.  Carefully mark with a pencil the best fit location.  Open the door, place the Gaurdian in the jamb. Mark the holes that you are going to fasten it with.  Grab an drill and bore an 1/8\\"" pilot hole for each screw about 1\\"" in depth.

I couldn't imagine them topping the original, but they did with these crackers.<br /><br />My favorite type of cheese is cheddar, so it actually makes sense that I would love these.  They have a very strong, sharp cheddar flavor.  It doesn't taste artificial at all, but tastes like the cheddar I buy for my sandwiches.  I can sit down and eat a box all by myself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they have lots of calories.  25 crackers contain 150 calories, almost half of which are from fat.

I vacillate between European grinds that have a slightly bitter after taste and the Cuban coffees that are rich and smooth. This one is the best of both worlds.<br /><br />This coffee has a subtle acidity that gives it the slight and highly desirable (to Italian palates) bitterness. But it has the body and richness of a great Cuban coffee. For folks like myself who love both this is a perfect bean. If you are more of a Cuban or Puerto Rican coffee aficionado you may find this to be a little rough. However, if you love European espresso, but have always wished for a deeper and richer cup this is pure heaven.<br /><br />One thing I love is the aroma when this is brewing. Itn fills my house. The grind is perfect for my [[ASIN:B000CNY6UK Bialetti 6800 Moka Espresso Maker]], as well as Melita style brewing.

And for something this expensive, you'd expect the absolute best quality but that is not the case here.  And yes, all of the above brands are both organic and grass-fed.  I am also bothered by the fact that this company chooses to manipulate the customer review system.

Now these cookies have become an obsession.<br /><br />The cookies have a flakey texture and have this lightly sweet taste that just makes my mouth water.  These crepe cookies are neatly packed into a golden wrapper with two crepe cookies.  The exterior has a wonderful golden color with a slight glaze to them.  Once a crepe cooke is in your mouth you can bite but the sweetness, which is not overpowering, just melts into your mouth.

3409,"This is very good, and quite similar to something I regularly make from scratch.  It's very easy, as well, because it doesn't require supervision.  Simply get it started and walk away (maybe stop to check on it every now and then).<br /><br />I have never had freeze dried corn and beans before, but the texture was fine in these.  I think having freeze-dried beans instead of plain old dried, uncooked beans, sped up the cooking time while keeping the texture of the other ingredients appropriate.<br /><br />Since I'm vegetarian, I used one quart of vegetable broth plus two cups of water instead of chicken broth and I used soy-based imitation chicken.  It worked quite well.  I also added shredded queso melt cheese and sour cream.  It was quite a good meal like that.  The taste was great, it had the perfect level of spiciness for me, and it makes great leftovers (nice if you're cooking for only one or two people).<br /><br />The sodium of this mix is low, but you can greatly increase the sodium levels depending on how you prepare it.  That's one reason I used a little water instead of all broth; I also used a low sodium broth instead of the regular kind.  I still thought this was quite flavorful.  Additionally, this has a lot of fiber and is very low in fat, if you are looking out for either of those.<br /><br />I'll probably still cook from scratch most of the time, but it's great to know I have this option now, especially for when I am in a hurry.",X_train

In my use I found it very difficulty to keep the filter in the device after cleanings which are often with a sick child. Eventually I lost the filter and was inhaling boogers on a daily basis. Even with that I still preferred to use this to the Nose Frida or your average bulb syringe.,X_train

3438,"Annie's rice pasta has a firm, toothsome texture that semolina pasta can't match, and the cheese is mildly sweet and tangy (the instructions say the cheese will stand up without butter, but use it anyway to cut minor Cheetos-like overtones).  Though pricy, it is nutritionally rich and has a good flavor, unlike regular macaroni, which is mostly filler and serves to deliver the cheese.    This product has the advantage of being gluten-free, but even if you're not on a restricted diet, I recommend it.  Both healthy and tasty, it's a step up from the garbage that got most of us through college.

3458,"I purchased the Britax B-Nimble to have as an alternative to our large/ heavy BOB stroller (which I love by the way!). I researched & read dozens of reviews for the best lightweight stroller with all the bells & whistles I was looking for.  If I had tested the B-Nimble out in a store - I would not have bought it.  It is NOT nearly as Nimble as it's name! And for the price/ brand, it has a poor design (this is a simple Umbrella stroller being marketed as something more).  In summary, the Con's outweight the Pro's for this stroller.  I wish I had returned right away :-(<br /><br />PROs -<br />- Fabric is nice & durable, I think you can also remove the cover to wash (haven't had to do this yet, since I avoid using this stroller due to the Con's - see below).<br />- Lightweight<br />- Shoulder strap is handy<br />- The extendable footrest is nice<br />- the center lock for the 5 point harness is nice & easy to use.<br /><br />CONs -<br />- Handling/ manuverability is terrible.  Maybe it's the two front-wheel design, but it's not easy to steer forward on simple ground surfaces - the wheels get caught easily & if they aren't parallel at all times, one will \\""flip\\"" around and stop any forward movement until you re-align the wheels.<br />- Canopy is awkward & flimsy.  It also doesn't pull down low enough to shield the sun/ rain/ wind from my daughters' face.<br />- The rear \\""step-down\\"" lock that holds the stroller open is broken, and the plastic piece spins around under my foot while trying to lock open the stroller.<br />- The mesh basket underneath is way too small.  But I guess that's what you get with an umbrella stroller.<br />- You need both hands to open & close this stroller. And in both cases, it is just awkward to do.<br />- Doesn't recline to a flat position.<br />- The parent cupholder is constantly falling off - between opening & closing, and moving the stroller from place to place.  It's just doesn't stay put, so we end up leaving it off, and not having a placeto put bottles/ cups.",X_train

They did not fair well in shipping and be sure to use a gentle hand in attempting to spread anything on them.

3528,"The color is random, so we got blue and it matches my daughter's backpack.<br /><br />I got this container after seeing a similar one at pottery barn kids. This one is less expensive, but actually looks better in person (and more functional). It doesn't look childish in any way and can easily be used as a lunchbox insert or on it's own. The container perfectly fits inside the standard lunch box (it's easier for my 1st grader to carry around and lunchboxes are insulated too). One of the departments has a leak proof lid though I have never tried putting liquid in it since I prefer to use the Thermos Foogo for soups and such. It works good for pasta with sauce though. I've made a mistake by putting in hot pasta once. Don't do it. The lid \\""sucks in\\"" and it's impossible for little hands to open.<br /><br />P.S. Dishwasher safe, BPA free and lead free",X_train

3547,"I buy it for backpacking. I didn't have the expiration date problem, but I DID notice that now, in the first week of February, I have until late June to eat 24 boxes of Rice-A-Roni before it expires. I'm sure I can handle it. One issue that concerns me, though, after poring over the ingredient list, is the use of the already mentioned disodium inosinate. The package doesn't tell the source of this salt, and much of it used in food is sourced from genetically modified organisms. I'm not paranoid about genetically modified salts as much as I despise companies just putting stuff in my food without telling me and letting me decide if I want to buy it. Genetically modified corn is a different story for another discussion. I love the taste of beef Rice-A-Roni, and I doubt that I'll throw any of it away. All the same, until I can find an answer about the makeup of the product, I probably won't buy any more, which saddens me. I've been eating it since I was a kid. I hope it doesn't turn out to be The San Francisco Genetically Modified Food Alternative Treat.

3552,"I've only had this baby monitor for a day or so and already I love it. We bought this because I had the bad habit of checking on my son too early (I wanted to make sure he actually fell asleep, but whenever he saw me, he'd think it was time to stand up and play - or, I'd hear him cry and I'd walk in to give him his binky, even though he'd have just grabbed it himself and didn't need me, which again, would make him think it was time to get up when he saw me).<br /><br />We had tried an audio monitor before, but didn't really need it. I could hear my son throughout our really small apartment, and it didn't stop me from walking in on him too early because he'd often be quiet for several minutes before actually falling asleep. For moms like me who like to check on their babies, this monitor is perfect. I can see the entire crib, and I can click it on or off whenever I'd like to take a peek. The image is clear enough that I can see when my son is asleep/awake/has his binky/doesn't have his binky/etc. Sometimes my signal blinks like it's too far out of range, which has me worried a little bit for when we move into our bigger house. I'll be sure to update my review if the range is affected.<br /><br />***Update***<br />We've now owned this monitor for over a year or so? Anyway, it still works great. The range is completely fine even for our new larger home. In fact, it might seem weird, but our monitor actually works better in our house (probably because there's more open space?) than it did in our small apartment. Go figure.<br /><br />The only problem we've had with it is that the antenna casing isn't too strong. We've broken it off and glued it back on several times.<br /><br />Other than that really small complaint though, I really love this product. It works so well for the price and has all the features I need. I've now purchased another camera, so I have two  and they work perfectly together. I love having one handheld monitor with multiple videos, which helps when I need to watch two rooms at once.

However, Spice Hunter's Saigon cinnamon has a delightful sweet flavor which goes splendidly with such offerings as cappuccino. Frontier, on the other hand, tastes like a mix of cinnamon and nutmeg, making it ideal for many desserts, eggnog and the like. The problem with Saigon? Relatively high levels of coumarin, a toxin which should not be consumed at more than 0.1 mg of kg of body weight. Thus for light use Saigon is plenty safe, and for years we've cheerfully sprinkled it atop foamed coffee two or three times a day. Great stuff.",X_train

This is a great way to eat healthy (only 4 grams of fat per serving) and sooooooo tasty with just the right amount of sweetnesss. Amazon also has the best price on this sauce.

3590,"When we brought our baby home from the hospital we had been spoiled with the easiest formula solution, the pre-made bottles! You just open, put a nipple on and throw it away! I loved this, but part of me didn't like all of the trash I was making, and a bigger part of me didn't like that i was paying for all those wasted bottles. So I bought this thing, it lets me buy bulk powder, but not have to deal with getting water the right temp, measuring anything, getting power everywhere, cleaning that crap, etc..  Setting this thing up is complicated, not because it has a lot of parts, which is does, or that the instructions are complicated, they aren't, it's because they covered the thing in &#34;DID YOU READ THE ENTIRE MANUAL BEFORE OPENING!!!!!&#34; labels everywhere, every dang piece of plastic, hinge, everything these labels. I guess a lot of folks decided to just &#34;figur'et out&#34; and when it doesn't work go on amazon and say's it sucks.  It's not a complicated device, it has a button for making 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10oz bottles. Pushing the button results in an array of servo noises and then some formula comes out, pretty simple, and really, works great.  The issues i have with it are: - Right now, the little guy really wants 3oz, so a more granular adjustment would help me not waste money. - I not very happy about having 100f water laying around for that long, so I chuck the water daily and refresh it. Also the water will taste metallic if left for more than 24 hours, probably due to the large metal heating element on the bottom. They should use a non-reactive heating element and do a sanitize cycle. - Why not have a built in water filter? I use my fridges filter, but tap water is every easier! I would've payed for that. - I get cleaning the formula opening, but the having to clean and dry both dispenser parts daily is a bit of a pain, why not make it one part, and use less edges so make it easier to clean. Also change the plastic so it doesn't bead and hold water so easily. - The securing action on the bottle height adjuster is sorta flaky. People who buy this have disposable income, so make it low, and add another servo to raise the bottle to the correct height!

3614,"I grew up buying 50 cent chocolate bars at the corner store -- chocolate was something tasty, but nothing particularly special. In high school, a German exchange student introduced me to European chocolate -- wow! I was still a big milk chocolate fan, but the cheap American stuff never satisfied.<br /><br />Now as an adult, I've become more concerned with the ingredients in my food and the way in which it is produced. If I want a treat, I'm a fair bit more discriminating now. The disparity between cheap chocolate candy and the good stuff (organic, fair trade chocolates) is very pronounced, and it took me a lot of research to begin spending 6x as much on chocolate bars. I believe I've come to the end of my research now that I've got Equal Exchange. Their methods are commendable, their ingredients are simple (chocolate liquor, cane sugar, cocoa butter, vanilla), and their chocolate is sublime.<br /><br />I honestly don't know how they do it. The [[ASIN:B001HTKN7S Green & Blacks Dark Chocolate 85% Cocoa (10x3.5oz)]] is as smooth as this one, but it contains whole milk powder. Unlike the [[ASIN:B0063A656Y Sweet Riot Yum Bar, 85% Dark Chocolate, 3.5-Ounce (Pack of 4)]] (which basically has the same ingredients), the taste is not sour or acidic. I don't think the 5% less cocoa content in this bar makes that much difference. Chocolate snobs talk about the \\""snap\\"" of chocolate bars, which I've never really understood, but this bar does have a nice snap (I think). I break the bars into individual squares and take them individually like vitamins (those flavanols have to be good for something, right?). This broke into even pieces better than any bar I've tried yet.<br /><br />I was concerned about getting items that had sat around in a warehouse for a long time, so I picked up a 12-pack of bars directly from the manufacturer. I received mine in December of 2012, and the expiration date is July of 2014. Each bar is inside a plastic sleeve, which must account for the shelf life.<br /><br />This is a fantastic chocolate bar. If you care about quality (both in the product and in the integrity of the company), you'll not be disappointed. That's something worth paying for, and having a luxury item like this makes eating it something special. Definitely not something you want to have on hand if you're prone to chocolate binges!",X_train

3625,"The Fisher-Price Woodlands Friends Space Saver Jumperoo is basically a scaled down, portable version of their Jumparoo series.  We have a Rainforest Jumparoo and are on our second son with it and they both just love it.  We got the space saver model as we are doing a bit of traveling and thought it would be handy to have somewhere fun to plop the 7 month old while we chase the 3 year old.  In that respect, it does the trick- it is fairly lightweight, folds up easily and is portable, which if you are familiar with the full-size Jumparoo models, know is just not an option with them.<br /><br />The product itself has the standard Fisher Price motif of colorful animals and bright patterns.  This model has squirrels and frogs.  One other positive is all the colors are gender neutral so there is no \\""boy\\"" or \\""girl\\"" model, so it is good for all children!  As with most Fisher-Price products, we find the Space Saver Jumparoo to be of high quality that should last and allow you to use the product until your baby outgrows it and even for future children.  It is sturdy plastic with plenty of support and balance and is easy to set up as everything just snaps into place.  As with other Fisher-Price bouncers, it is adjustable, has several dangly things meant to catch baby's attention, and noises and lights that play when he is jumping.<br /><br />Having said that, we do prefer the full size model.  This Jumparoo is fine but we feel the bigger version gives him more movement- the chair swivels in a complete 360 to allow baby to follow things that are going on in the room. The full size model also has three posts with the elastic material attached whereas this model only has one.  You can just tell, this model is a bit more of an effort to bounce in and he gets tired more easily.  Of course we realize that you have to give something up for the mobility and space savings but if you can only get one and your space permits, we would recommend the full size version over making this your everyday bouncer.  However, if you have the need and the budget for a mobile version- then this is the one you need..

It provides variety so that when your kid plays with it a lot, you don't get stuck listening to the same noises over and over again. I was disappointed in how easily the Pelican's mouth piece would fall off - kids are notoriously rough on toys, so I'm surprised by how flimsy this part of the toy was constructed. Overall though, it does not detract too much for the intent of the toy and our little boy enjoys it a lot.

3672,"I purchased the Beco Butterfly and have been using it for few weeks.   Here is my take on it and I'm going to be detailed since I was desperate for some detailed review when I was researching....    Pros:  -It's really nice looking...I get complements on it. It is the most attractive carrier I've seen so far.  -It's good quality...very sturdy, quality workmanship, good fabric  -It does distribute the weight to the hip so back does not hurt as much..so I don't mind wearing it for a long time. I have not noticed any irritation on my son after a long wear neither...it has padding for his legs.  -It's quick to get on but the buckle that was put in due to that previous recall is pain in the butt. It takes a lot of fiddling around with to adjust the top straps but it's super fast once you have it set since there really is no need to change it.  -It holds the baby nice and close to me (adjustable) and my baby is happy in it and sleeps in it well.  -I like the buckles vs tying stuff...it's quick...snap snap and it's done  -Infant insert works very well with my 5 month old (now almost 6 months)      Cons:  -It's padded and hot like the Bjorn, which sucks. It has the outer layer, baby insert layer, and another layer that lays on me directly...that's 3 layers with outer layer being pretty thick (not as thick as the Bjorn though). Yah...no wonder it makes my chest and stomach all sweaty after a walk in the hot weather.  -The back buckle is hard to reach and push down.  -I kinda don't like the straps...they are regular heavy duty nylon straps. It's good quality but it's not the softest thing to be rubbing against my baby's skin...most of the time it's out of the way but still....  -The headrest attaches awkwardly and is useless for infants...maybe it'll come in handy when he is a toddler.  But my baby has no problem sleeping in it and I really haven't had to use it at all.  -I tried to put it on my husband's back...baby freaked and was not happy. It is bit too small for his wideback and my son was uncomfortable...perhaps we need to do more adjusting but adjusting the thing is not that easy with all the buckles. It's only easy once everything has been set up just right....but not so switching to diff person where every strap needs to be readjusted.  -I also find myself wanting the outward facing option...for those short periods when i want my son to see what's going on (like the 4th of July fireworks)    I do take it everywhere and use it a lot. I love how he sits in it. A friend of mine recently got a Moby wrap and she loves it. But I have to admit that I am not fond of how it looks on...all that extra fabric hanging and the tie knot...not so attractive. But it does look like it would be good for a little baby.     I am generally very happy with this carrier since its super easy now its all adjusted, comfy for my son, and have beautiful prints.    Update: Started putting my son in the main compartment out of the infant insert and the canvas material does make red marks on his thighs and he seems uncomfortable in it.  Very disappointed.

3677,"I can't say enough good things about this product. My baby initially used the Tummytub when she didn't have enough head support to sit by herself. She's big for her age and now that she's 8 months, the Tummytub was clearly way too small for her. This fits perfectly in our tiny bathroom shower stall (which doesn't actually have a tub...that's city life for you!) and she can finally spread her legs and splash around during bath time.<br /><br />She did slip once when she tried to reach for the showerhead outside of the tub, and I was holding her obviously so it was fine, but I'd only start using this once the baby has very good head support and can do with you holding her stomach or back w/ one hand whie you wash with the other.

Of course, they are a cheap plastic but nothing that you wouldn't expect for a cupcake topper at this price.  I would give these five stars as they were perfect for my purposes.

3685,"I have to admit, the quality of the bag is very good. It has many pouches to store big and small items. Other reviews talk about the about the positive points of this bag.<br />However, this bag lacks a few basic design points.<br />1. The big ticket items for any infant/kid such as diapers, wipes, formula, games have to be stored in the lower part of the bag since it has big pouches for these items. Once you put all these items, the bag becomes huge at the bottom and becomes difficult to close using the zip.<br />2. Secondly. the laundry bag idea is great but no place to keep it once it becomes full. You have to carry it in a separate bag or may be squeeze at the top of the bag.<br />3. It gives some space for clothes but not too much. May be you can carry 5 pieces of dresses.<br /><br />Overall, it is a great travel bag. It they had addressed these issues, it would have been the best backpack diaper bag! Hope subsequent versions have some design consideration.",X_train

Possibly some models of the pac n play are different sizes, as I read one review that it was a perfect fit.  For mine, there is about an 1.5\\"" narrower than the original pad.  Not a big deal - a infant could possibly drop a pacifier beside it, but to me no safety issue.  Since the pac n play has the soft mesh sides, there is give regardless.  My grand daughter has slept very well on it!  Has two sides - one which is water proof - and as a result a little firmer, and the other side which is not water proof, but a little softer.  So you have that choice.  I definitely recommend this product, especially if you have a pac n play.  Just measure your crib to make sure it will fit well.",X_train

3720,"C2O is not the first coconut water we have tried.  I've tried most of the typical natural-foods store refrigerator case brands (VitaCoco, Zico, O.N.E., etc) and I honestly concluded that I just don't like coconut water and would never choose to drink it with other options around.  This was confirmed when I purchased a couple of young Thai coconuts.  I found the liquids to be odd tasting, like something at the start of going bad rather than something fresh and vibrant.  Just not my thing.<br /><br />I continued to buy those brands, thinking they were an easier alternative to opening coconuts, when I needed liquid to add to my famous (in my own mind) raw coconut macaroons.  I always try to add a liquid with some nutritional value, even if it is mostly vitamins, electrolytes, yadda yadda yadda.  The other flavors in the macaroons eclipsed any weird taste of the coconut water, and all was good.<br /><br />Then I tried C2O and while I'm not going to be drinking coconut water daily, it is such an improvement over all of the other brands.  The flavor is fresh and sweet and pretty good when served fresh from the fridge.  As a type 1 diabetic, I did not the carb counts and I usually choose carb/calorie free fluids.  I will, though, reach for one of these next time I am feeling dehydrated, and I will use this as the base for my electrolyte &#34;cocktail&#34; I make for my family when we are ill.  As far as my macaroons, I would rather use this and have the flavor enhanced by all of the ingredients rather than feeling like I have to cover up anything, even in the slightest bit.<br /><br />I did take a star off as I'm not a fan of the packaging.  I prefer, even for this size, a resealable container especially when a product has more than one serving per container.  Also, a search revealed that these cans are, according to bloggers who contacted the company, BPA free.  I typically avoid goods in metal cans for that reason, but it's good to know that I don't have to compromise on this product.

I should say that I buy them somewhere else and thrilled to see I can buy them at a place with some standards.  I have never been sorry I did business with Amazon and expect this purchase will be the same as always, excellent.    The only down side, and I hope it is due to my making a mistake in reading it is the price.  I have been paying just over five bucks for the bag of 100 - and the shop is here in Mpls.  Nine with shipping is very excessive, it seems so I am going to research things more closely to see if I can get a better deal.  I did not see watermelon either but being such a big flavor of candy in Mexico, expect I will find them and also be able to make a better deal.  So, if the real price is near five dollars, They will have gained a new customer in candy - probably their billionth.    Once I have actually tried their version of this candy, I WILL write a more studied opinion.  One you can always trust.  If I say it is objective, it will be.  If it isn't, I will say so then as well.    I see that by just applying for an Amazon Visa card, I can get three bags for nearly free.

We tried putting socks on her, but she only pulled them off and kept waking herself up. We went back to the sleep sacks with no foot openings, and have had no problems. I highly recommend Halo sleep sacks, but if you have children that move around a lot at night and take their socks off while putting themselves to sleep, you might want to stick to the regular style and avoid the pre-walkers.

Neither did I see any excess lint accumulate while drying, which happened with other fleece blankets. Keep in mind that the blanket is on a smaller side (30x30), however, it works for me. It looks cute too, I love the polka dots.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/29/2016<br />It has been almost six months since I started using this blanket after my baby was born. It is an OKAY blanket but nothing more than that. We have it in the car to cover the baby on chilly days so we don't use it every day. It's been washed maybe 6 times and I recently noticed it lose its initial plush appearance. Still soft, just not as smooth and plush as it used to be.<br /><br />What really made me come back and update my review is the fact that I since discovered these fleece blankets are available from 99cents store for $1.99. The same fabric type/shape/size just five times cheaper! They actually have more pattern/color choices (I bought blue stripe, red stripe, green polka dot, multicolor with cars, green with elephants, pink with hearts etc. for gifts as well as for my own baby's needs. I got SIX blankets for like $12. What's more, 99cent store blankets are an inch wider! So I feel like this one was a big rip off.",X_train
3755,"I first tried this on a whim in a cafe in Boulder (the hometown of this tea) and I was so amazed that I actually had to find this on Amazon. It smells deliciously of a nutty vanilla, practically like candy. The taste does not disappoint its aroma. It's subtly sweet that you won't need to add honey, even if you're a honeynut like me, but the flavor is soft enough to enjoy without being overwhelmed. This is my personal favorite best vanilla almond rooibos loose leaf and I've already gifted it twice to a couple of very happy friends. It's also gluten-free, sugar-free, and caffeine-free if that is a concern for you!<br /><br />The rooibos leaves are paper thin (albeit long, sort of half of a 2D rice grain in length) so they have the potential to flow out of infusers if the mesh isn't fine enough. They flowed out of my more-so decorative leaf-steam infuser, but not from my twist-lock capped mesh infuser. There are also pieces of almond in the tea, just like as shown in the elephant graphic on the tin. The tin itself has a red twist-lock cap with a second metal lid that fits securely with the tin in order to seal in the tea's freshness and maximize shelf life.<br /><br />Overall, great design for the tin and delicious flavor for the tea!

3760,"The company seems to have given us some sort of floor model. We expected good clean furniture. We got dings scratches and even a broken top rail. It would be beautiful if it looked new and undamaged....The wood is sturdy. Even though there is a crack in the wood around one of the screws where a machine or person tried to screw in too tightly, it seems to not effect the structural integrity. The color is great matching the picture exactly. I am not sure why we were not informed or given some sort of discount for the terrible shape this particular set is in. We are supposed to send it back so they can refund us and resell it to someone else. I feel cheated/suckered.

The light is very soothing, and she loves how it goes pink-red!      The only reason I cannot give this five stars, is because the 15 minute dimmer is only on one setting.  My daughter knows how to press the bottom button to change from color to color, thus taking the GloMate off the dimmer setting.

3787,Fairly easy to make but the food coloring was really thick and didn't dispense easily. I made 12 cupcakes and a tiny sheet cake. It didn't crumble but it didn't hold together and was not as strong as other cakes. The texture was very fine and spongy. While I was mixing the batter I noticed that it smelled like flour and checked the ingredients for flavoring but didn't see any. I added some vanilla extract. Well the cake still tastes bland. The colors are extremely vibrant. But otherwise I will never get this again. Luckly I didn't buy it in the first place as it was a gift from a family member.,X_train

It's not advertised nor intended to be the high cocoa % that is in the harsher dark. I personally find it to be the best combination of sweet milk chocolate and the more \\""real\\"" dark chocolate. Usually IMO dark chocolate when coming from a sweet society is an acquired taste and you kind of build up to the higher %. It's a good starter dark! If you go immediately from milk to high % dark and are expecting anything sweet at all  you will be disappointed. If you have moved on passed this level of dark... you would already know to check the level of dark and the amount of peppers included in many specialty darks.

3804,"I looked at the Graco Nautilus, and decided against it as many people reported that the crotch strap was positioned to rearward, resulting in children either sitting on the strap or even on the buckle. To verify, I went to Target and sat my 4-year old on the Nautilus with the crotch strap positioned as forward as possible; her butt was on the strap. I looked at other models from Safety 1st and Evenflo, but their harness boosters had a maximum capacity of 40 lbs. in harness mode; my niece is already over 35 lbs. Then there was Recaro's harness booster, which seemed perfect, until I noticed that there were no cup holders! What were they thinking, especially for a car seat designed for older toddlers?<br /><br />I didn't have such problems with the Britax Frontier 85. There are two cupholders, so the child or adult sitting next to the child in the harness booster can use the spare. At 85 lbs. maximum capacity in harness booster mode and 120 lbs. in belt-positioning booster mode, I know that this will be the last car seat we'll have to buy. The headrest has wings for side-impact protection, but there's the invaluable bonus that she can rest her head to the side and not slump her head forward. The headrest height adjusts without having to re-thread the harness.<br /><br />Huge note: When installing this via LATCH, you must thread the excess strap through the slot at the corner of the seat and pull, thus pulling the strap toward the seat. If pulled away from the seat, the installation will be loose, as the strap will resist being pulled. I found this out from the installation video much later, because I didn't bother reading the manual. Before finding this out, I had a horrible time installing this. Now, installation is a breeze.",X_train

3809,"At a coworker's recommendation I bought an espresso machine not too long ago. He also told me to buy Lavazza coffee, which I did - I bought a can of their Cafe Espresso. To my complete disappointment, though, my espressos weren't coming out as creamy as I thought that they would. I blamed the lack of crema on the espresso maker. Then a few days ago I saw the Crema & Gusto recommended to me by Amazon, and I decided to give it a shot since I was running out of coffee anyway. Oh my, oh my, how happy I am. The coffee is really creamy, thick, and with that beautiful crema layer that I was hoping to get from the beginning. The coffee comes out strong but not bitter. It's really flavorful and just simply delicious, and I can see that my problem before wasn't my espresso machine, but the coffee I was using. I highly recommend this product and I will certainly buy it again (not to mention that less than $20 for 4 bricks of 8.8oz of quality coffee isn't a bad price).

3817,"Thinking Kraft mac and cheese powder was too expensive, I bought this at a bulk food store thinking I could make \\""my own\\"", cheaper \\""easy mac\\"".  Holy cow was I wrong. Lets check the numbers...<br /><br />Easy mac is $3 for a 6 pack at Walmart, which is 50 cents/pack if you throw away the noodles.  Each pack comes with 20g (or 0.7oz) of cheese powder.  At 50 cents per 0.7oz that equals $11.43 per pound of actual Kraft Easy Mac powder, not counting all the noodles.<br /><br />This stuff costs MORE than that... a LOT more, and also contains a fairly large amount of partially hydrogenated oils, which are terrible for your health.<br /><br />Kraft cheese powder does NOT contain hydrogenated oils (hydrogenation is a cheap way of making oil take up about 10% more weight, while costing the manufacturer nearly nothing, it's a way to skimp on costs, except hydrogenation has been proven to reduce life expectancy.  This is already banned in Europe and some parts of the US like NYC).<br /><br />Aside of the health issues, this stuff is so expensive that you could buy easymac, throw away the boxes, the noodles, the plastic, etc. and still come ount ahead.

Yes, the texture may seem a bit off-putting for some.  But for someone like me who can't eat normal pasta, these truly are a miracle noodle.  The garlic flavor in particular gives a nice mild taste to the noodle.  If you put a bit of Earth Balance (or butter, etc) on them, the salt helps to balance the flavor.  The texture is kind of chewy, but I would not compare it to a jellyfish like a previous reviewer!  I have tried seaweed noodles before, and THOSE taste and have texture like jellyfish.

I saw these on Amazon and took a chance; my son loved them, so I ordered another pack to make sure I always had a clean one on hand. All the little nubs seem to keep him stimulated, and the shape is perfect for chubby hands to hold. My son got his first tooth a little on the early side (4 1/2 months) and he is ALWAYS looking for something to stick in his mouth. I like to put these on pacifier clips when he's in his car seat so he has something to keep him occupied. They are easy to wash (I just throw them in a soaking bin in the kitchen sink along with his bottles/breast pump parts) and dry quickly. I haven't had any cracking issues at all.",X_train
3848,Bought two this for the second car and grandma. I like it better than the expensive one we bought.

Pros: super easy to install and really easy to get the kid in and out of.,X_train

3852,"Great toothbrush! We ordered this for our then-8 month old and our pediatric dentist actually gave us a freebie set as part of our goodie bag! My daughter loves this toothbrush. She's actually not picky since she loved her $2.99 winnie-the-pooh one that we got from Target, BUT I love that this one has a long handle.  Since she's at the stage where she doesn't want me to brush her teeth FOR her, it's nice for me to grab ahold too. She wants to do it herself (by chewing on the bristles) but I can still guide her with the long parent-handle.<br /><br />This toothbrush comes with a hand guard which I haven't used yet since I opened the package from our dentist (which didn't have it) so I can't speak to it but I like the idea of baby not being able to hold it way far back on the handle and cause herself to gag on it.<br /><br />Very soft squishy fun handle, rubbery soft siliconey toothbrush head back.<br /><br />Haven't used the tongue scraper thing, I don't think my 10 month old would like that very much. Instead, she chews on it at the end of her brushing session, then we say &#34;yay&#34; and clap for her.<br /><br />Makes infant tooth brushing fun!",X_train

We were able to pop the cast off in less than 15 minutes and it was fully dry a day later.  Also, there was enough material leftover to do at least one more cast, so it might be fun for others to do one cast in both the 2nd and 3rd trimesters.

3885,"I am a big fan of Krusteaz muffin mixes -- I usually bake several dozen once a month or so (oat bran and fat-free banana are my favorites), then freeze them and have a couple for breakfast every morning (I nuke them on high for about 10 seconds each and they are ready).  I had never tried this kind before as it's not one my local grocery stores carry, so I bought a case from amazon.  The first time I baked them, they smelled AMAZING in the oven and I was looking forward to trying them.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the taste -- they were just very, very, very bland.  They tasted to me somewhat like vanilla muffins (I can't taste anything like almonds in them), but actually they didn't have much of a taste at all.    With my second box, I added frozen mixed berries (blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries) to the mix -- I think about a cup or cup and a half of the berries (no need to defrost them first).  This improved the taste quite a bit, so I think this muffin mix just needs SOMETHING added.    I will continue to add fruit (maybe nuts too at some point) to the 10 boxes I have left, but I doubt that I will order any more.  I really wanted to like these and am surprised no one else mentioned how bland they are.  (Maybe it's just me.)",X_train

3887,"The positive:   We bought this tub, because we liked the clean water idea which it definitely delivers on.  Suds, pee etc go down right away so you don't feel like your baby is sitting in dirty water.  Our newborn fit snugly and didn't slip around too much.  It was also nice to have the thermometer as nervous new parents.    The negative:  The way the tub is contoured as soon as your baby gets a little bigger his bum rests at what is basically the end of the tub and his feet come up on top of the bum rest.  Unfortunately this means his feet are always out of the water and once he gets a little older he can't really splash.  Additionally, our thermometer broke after a month of use and made this horrible beeping sound we couldn't get to stop for two days.      Our baby is 4 months and now we have to buy another tub.  If I had it to do again I would have bought something that would have lasted longer.  Especially for the price.",X_train

I get two 12oz cups out of each bag, brewing the first one for 3 minutes and the second for 4.  I drink the first with no sweetener as I'm trying to keep my sugar consumption down.  The second is slightly tannic so I use 1/2 tsp of honey and it's delicious.  I wouldn't put milk in this as that would overwhelm the delicate flavor.<br /><br />I like that Choice teas are organic and fair trade.  I saw that some reviewers complained about the bags breaking and one mentioned that the string was stapled.  The bags I just purchased are stitched and seem very secure so maybe Choice took a note from some of the other reviewers and changed their construction.<br /><br />I make no claim to be a tea connoisseur but I'd say this is moderately priced for a premium tea and a good choice for enjoying every day.",X_train

3898,"This is the 2nd Levana monitor that I've had and, just like with my first one, it has several annoying issues.  Number one: the picture freezes ALL THE TIME. Not just the standard way when there's no movement. NO. Like when I hold and kiss the baby, put her in her crib, rub her tummy a minute, walk into my room, look at the monitor and the picture is a fractured image of me holding her from 5 minutes ago! Restarting the unit doesn't always fix this issue. And it happens ALL THE TIME. My other Levana model did the same thing.  Number two: The rotation of the camera is horrible. It takes so many readjustments and weird placements to finally get a good angle for a picture. The other Levana camera that I have is able to rotate in every direction, so you simply hang it once and point the camera. Sounds simple, doesn't it? Why on earth they changed their GOOD product to the horribly limited one they have now, i have no idea.  Number three: the parent-end unit BEEPS loudly whenever you turn it on. Super annoying. Even more annoying when you pair it with the next thing on my list...  Number four: THERE IS NO MUTE! Let's face it, sometimes your kid just makes noise and there's no reason to mess with them, especially when you can SEE that they're fine. And it's 2am and you want to go back to sleep. But there's no mute on your monitor... if you turn the monitor off, then the next time you want to check on the baby IT WILL BEEP AND WAKE YOUR PARTNER UP. So you can't turn it off. But you can't sleep with that noisy baby chatter. So you bury it under the blankets and TRY to sleep. Does this sound the like kind of regular procedure you should have to perform with a device that costs as much as this one? NO!!  DEAR LEVANA: for goodness sakes, PLEASE figure out how to make a product with more efficient video quality and PUT A FRICKING MUTE FEATURE on your products!!  As for the \\""good\\"" parts about this product - the music playing and talking to baby features are great. I love being able to see the actual temperature of the baby's room at all times. And the parent hand-unit is pretty self-explanatory, which is nice. It even has a stand on the back, which was a big complaint of mine on my previous Levana monitor.

Add in 1-2 packs of sweetener and it has a very similar taste to coffee shop pumpkin spice.<br /><br />I was torn between this flavor and pumpkin spice, so I'm curious as to the flavor difference between the two.

3917,"My 11-month old will not sleep well in a Pack n Play.  In addition, Pack n Plays are too heavy and big for air travel.  So, I decided to buy the Bjorn Travel Crib Light 2 despite its price (only slightly cheaper than my actual crib).  For the past two days my baby has taken her naps in the Bjorn crib and really likes it!  I was very skeptical because she loves her crib, and does not  sleep well anywhere else.  So, much to my surprise, my baby did take her usual 2-hour nap in the Bjorn crib.  She also played in it for a good 25 minutes without crying to get out!  So, this travel crib would be just perfect, EXCEPT for the non-mesh sides, which are somewhat unsettling to me.  They say the sides are breathable, but honestly, I don't think they are. I put my mouth against the fabric and could not really breath well,  and I am in my mid thirties! So I am not sure how they say babies can breath. I did a research and could not find any negative feedback (only one here) with bad experiences about this concern, so I guess statistics show that the bottom fabric is not really an issue.

3922,"I didn't know what I was getting when I ordered these.  I ordered them because they were on a good sale.  I thought maybe they were some sort of chocolate, but they turned out to taste a lot like Good N Plenty's.  Overall they taste fine, but 6.6 pounds is going to last a looong time.",X_train

That is much more expensive, but good for taking to the office or on the road.",X_train

3935,"This is my favorite granola. Great taste, chewy, generous with nuts, natural ingredients, and the company has a wholesome and green attitude. Super! There is one significant caveat . . . they are very devious with the nutritional information, so beware!  The \\""serving size\\"" is listed as 1/4 cup, enough to feed a small bird. I always mix this with Post Shredded Wheat/Wheat'n Bran (and use soy milk), probably the most nutritious and honest cereal out there. Perhaps the only cereal with no sugar or sweeteners (or salt). Tasty and plenty of fiber, too. And reasonably priced. If you are concerned with healthy eating, don't pass Post Shredded Wheat, Wheat n'Bran by. It has a nice crunch and taste, though mixing it with Bear Naked Fruit and Nut makes for a more roundly delicious meal. The Post Shredded Wheat/Wheat'n Bran lists a serving as 1 1/4 cups. Realistic. Compare that to Bear Naked's 1/4 cup and you will see that Bear Naked, despite its great taste, is extremely caloric. 1 1/4 cups of Bear Naked has 35g of fat, or 55% of the Daily Value and 700 calories! 1 1/4 cups of the Post cereal has 2% of the Daily Value and 200 calories. So for taste and enjoyment I would give Bear Naked five stars, but for the dishonest nutritional information, I lower that to 3.",X_train

But, I have decided to sell mine and get the city mini double b/c yesterday we hit a TINY bump in the sidewalk and the stroller came to a crashing halt and literally tipped over with both kids in it! The wheels are simply too small for the size of the stroller and unless you are walking on the street with no bumps, this thing is VERY difficult to manage and steer.    I like it for many reason, but that was the last straw. It shouldn't be that hard to push my two kids around. If they were smaller, maybe. But my 3 and 1 year old are simply too much weight (and they aren't big kids) to make this manageable.",X_train

And if they do leak it is usually because I didn't stuff them properly (overnight) or they need to be stripped, which you must do with any cloth diaper to remove detergent build up. The price is not bad either. Bottom line, they are reliable, cute, and fit my big baby very well. If I ever have another baby I will only be using Charlie Banana diapers!",X_train

It was hard to differentiate between each beam in the picture. The crib was much larger than we anticipated but it was sturdy and of good quality. The drawers are sturdy and easy to manage without any gaps or catches in the opening and closing. We thought that the changing platform could have been thicker even though it does have a middle support beam. The colour was great and will match any decor. I was impressed with the response time for shipping and received it very quickly! The items were in good condition and all present. I would suggest using a ratcheting screw driver for assembly. It made things easier and quicker along with being easy on the wrist. I wouldn't suggest a drill, it might be too powerful and split the wood.

3978,"I had high hopes for this food grinder.  The fresh food feeder is okay--my 8-month old likes eating cantaloupe from it.  But I was very disappointed by the grinder.  Here's why:  1) The grinder is shaped awkwardly.  You have to hold onto the upright middle part of the grinder while pushing downward so the food gets pushed up to the grinding blade.  It can be hard to apply enough downward pressure to do this, and it's fatiguing to push down with one hand while grinding with the other.  2) It takes a lot of effort to grind just a little bit of food.  It took me about 2 minutes of grinding to get less than 1 ounce of ground green beans.  8 minutes of grinding by hand to get a 4-ounce feeding while the baby is hungry?  No thank you!  3) Ground food is too course for my 8-month old baby.  I tried feeding him two bites from the grinder, and he gagged so hard he almost threw up.  Maybe it's okay for babies eating \\""Stage 3\\"" foods, but not for younger babies.  4) The grinder is hard to disassemble.  During assembly, you rotate the metal disk into the base of the bowl so it doesn't come loose while grinding.  But there's no easy way to get the metal disk back out for cleaning.  I ended up having to use a fork to pry/rotate the metal disk out.    I'm taking the grinder back and getting a food processor instead.",X_train

I only found that the upper part of the leg was a bit tricky, but once I got the hang of the first one, it was easy sailing with the others. I'm very pleased with my purchase. I did not want something too busy or that had many bells and whistles. This was just enough for my little one. Much better than paying $99 for one of the other models! Great buy.

I can get our \\""going out all day\\"" diaper bag for two kids in there but I really have to cram it in and then it's hard to get to the things I need without taking older daughter off and pulling the whole thing out. 3) it would be nice if the older child had somewhere to put a sippy cup in the back. and 4)I'm not sure where I'm going to put shopping bags when we go to the mall, if I hung them from the push bar as I usually do they will be right in my daughters face.    On the plus side it is very sturdy, easy to put together and maneuvers easily.   I liked this option because it is slightly more compact than other double stroller options and is convenient since my daughter likes to walk a lot and I can get her on and off quickly.  It fits easily in my hyundai elantra hatchback with room to spare (I'm fighting getting a bigger vehicle tooth and nail), but i do have to take off the infant seat attachment and the sun shade to fit it most compactly.

We  have the deedee brand sleep sack and a Dwell studio sleep sack (both too small now) and those both have snaps at the shoulders, which makes it MUCH easier to get a squirmy or very sleepy baby snuggled into the sleep sack.

4007,"Stouffer's Stuffed Peppers, 15 ½ oz. Large Size.<br />These stuffed peppers are good, but taste a bit salty. For anyone with high blood pressure, and restricted to a low salt diet, the amount of salt per serving is high, about twice what you would get in a hotdog, and hotdogs are high in salt to begin with.  The amount of salt in the 10 oz., one stuffed pepper package is 990 mg, and the amount of salt in the 15 ½ oz. two stuffed peppers package is 1600 mg.  The larger package has two medium sized stuffed peppers, the regular 10 oz. size has one large stuffed pepper.  It is just as easy to eat all the food in the larger package, as the difference in weight is mostly in the extra tomato sauce.  If the salt content is not an issue for you, go ahead and chow down, but you may have some extra water retention issues with the roughly 50% larger package of food.  You will gain some temporary weight in fluid retention until the extra salt leaves your system.  Warnings aside, the stuffed peppers in both packages taste good, but leave a salty aftertaste.  If you like extra salt, you can always add your own, but you can't remove it once it is there. Before cooking a meal in a microwave oven, I always poke a hole in the top plastic cover and add about an ounce of water to help prevent drying out and burning. At the dinner table, I prefer adding an Italian blend of six shredded cheeses, instead of grated cheese from a shaker.

4008,"My cat is of course not thrilled about me putting this on him, which makes it difficult to snap on, but that is no fault of the harness, so my review is not about that.  However, in order to have this tight enough that my cat cannot slip out of it with relative ease, I would have to make it choke him. If the leash is taut, and he backs away from the pressure, the harness just slips right off.  I've triple-checked the instructions to make sure I'm securing it properly, and I've had other animal-savvy people do it as well, and nothing will prevent this from happening unless I risk cutting off his airway.  I've never used a harness on my cat before, so perhaps all of them have this flaw and what I want is just impossible.",X_train
4009,"I love these stickers! They look adorable and are easy to apply!! They are quite larger than what i was expecting, the largest butterfly and flower is about 8-10 inches in diameter, which is fantastic for the amount of space i needed to fill!!",X_train
4010,"I love to drink water as soon as I get up in the morning. Drinking water is good but It does not agree with me in the morning, before meal, so instead I drink coconut water. I have tried different brands  and so far this is the best one for me. It taste fresh and sweeter not like the others.",X_train
4011,The backs of my front row seats on my Altima have been destroyed by kids' shoes so when I leased a new Odyssey I needed to protect the seats. These mats are good quality and have been standing up to abuse for 6 months now. The straps haven't ripped like others I've tried.,X_train
4012,"When my wife told me we were going to buy a $270 bassinet I was extremely skeptical.  I just didn't see a value for the short time we would be utilizing the bassinet.<br /><br />Well, one month in and I am a believer.  The ability to remove the bassinet from the base and move the baby to whatever room in the house with very little effort is a huuuuuge bonus.  I know you can get this with other bassinets, but I doubt it as easy.  The provided handles and grips make it trivial.  We also have a large dog who loves his new little one and with this bassinet we can easily keep the dog from getting to the baby when he is sleeping.<br /><br />The build quality is great.  I don't worry about any components breaking or whether this will last us.  I expect we would be able to resell this without an issue.  You can buy replacement padding as well so if you have a spit up issue just swap them out and clean at your leisure.<br /><br />Highly recommend and worth every penny.",X_train
4013,This was supposed to be a variety pack but instead I received 12 of the same kind. The flavor I got tasted fine but it was disappointing that it was not the variety pack.,X_train

4016,"The flexible weighted straw is a brilliant piece of design and works really well.  The cheap plastic that the cup is made from particularly the rim around the bottom (which isn't even necessary) broke and shattered into some really sharp and easily swallowed pieces (See picture) the second time my son dropped the cup on the ground.  Sometimes I wonder if industrial designers ever test the products they make in real world situations! Anyone that has a kid knows how often the lease things get dropped.  If they redesigned the base so it wouldn't shatter into dangerous pieces when dropped I'd give it 5 stars, but given the cheap plastic and steep price for a baby cup it's no more than 3 stars.",X_train
4017,I never had any problems with the bottles. I read a review where their baby had bad gas; remember that ALL babies get gas. It could be from what you are feeding your child not from the bottles. Try watching what you eat (if you are breastfeeding/pumping) or try another type of formula. Give the bottles another chance. I love them!,X_train

I've never had an experience where more that one (ok maybee 2) came out at a time with this dispenser. Worth every penny especially if you're changing diapers for multiple babies day in and day out.,X_train
4022,"A few months back when I started working my office job, and went on a tea buying frenzy.<br />I brought almost every brand and almost every flavor that i saw go on sale over the course of a month at pathmark.<br />However, almost all the green tea brands i had brought from pathmark had a horrible aftertaste and made me want to throw up.<br /><br />So far, Toasted rice green tea is the only one i have been able to tolerate without feeling like throwing up and it also has a really pleasant taste. I offered to my co-workers and managers and they all praised how great it tasted.<br />In a way, it is not too strong or too brunt but just right.<br /><br />If you have gone to a great Japanese, it is most likely you have tasted Toasted rice green tea before.",X_train

4026,"I purchased this for travel.<br /><br />After reading all sorts of horror stories about pack n plays folding up on babies, I was really nervous about several upcoming trips we have.  We have a standard issue Graco pack n play that is great for containing baby when we are close by.  However, I couldn't get comfortable with the idea of her being in a room by herself sleeping in that now that she is wiggling all around the crib at night.  The pack n play we have is the basic one with no bells and whistles.<br /><br />On top of that, we recently spent 2 nights with the grandparents who have a crib for her, but no changing table.  My back was screaming after 48 hours of changing and dressing her on a bed.  OUCH!<br /><br />So my search began.  I am admittedly obsessive about purchases, and being a mother has made it much worse.  I research products for weeks on line and check them out in store before buying anything.<br /><br />Out of the box, the Joovy Room is impressive with its sleek design and quality materials.  My den has been overrun by snuggapuppies.  This is a welcome change.<br /><br />When assembled, this thing is rock solid.  Popping it into place is a breeze.  Attaching the mattress & sheet, not so much.  It takes time, but will probably get easier the more I do it.  There's a lot of velcro strips to weave through holes.  It makes the mattress very secure, but will take time.<br /><br />The changing table is, by far, the best on the market.  It's open at both ends if you have a taller baby.  The height of the changing table is around 30&#34; from the floor.  A nice height to save your back. It is difficult to snap onto the side rails.  I am hoping these loosen with use.<br /><br />The bassinet seems very secure.  I'm not sure what people are referring to about the mattress/sheet bunching up around their baby's nose.  Not sure how that would happen if baby is sleeping on their back??  The bassinet is a few inches narrower than the lower play/sleep area.  Because of this the mattress has cushioned side strips that fold along the long side.  Instructions say to fold these under the mattress before securing in place.  Maybe if they were folded up it would obstruct breathing?  I'm not sure.  My baby is already past the weight limit for the bassinet so we won't be using it.<br /><br />The carry bag has a side pocket that is probably intended for the bassinet.  Since we don't need the bassinet, I was able to get the storage shelves and the changing table (disassembled) into the side pocket.  It's a tight fit, but it will go.<br /><br />It would be great if Joovy made a changing table cover.  The sheet that comes with it is a very, very thick t-shirt type material.  Washed very nicely.  I would buy a changing table cover if they made it.",X_train
4027,Ask a Costa Rican (&#34;Tico&#34;) what brand of coffee they have at home and the majority will tell you 1820. That support is well deserved. Normally I would buy smaller amounts (as do the locals) since the large packages on the store shelves sit unused for much longer. However since pricing on a kilo was advantageous and I have a vacuum sealer here at home I bought the full 2.2 lbs. A fresh grind of these whole beans is like returning to the patio overlooking the Golfo Dulce at sunrise...,X_train
4028,Bigger than I expected which was a pleasant surprise...super cute...I keep all &#34;wet&#34; items such as my baby butt cream and my hand lotion and chap stick in here...basically anything I don't want to ruin my actual diaper bag if it were to open or leak.

4033,I love this soup.  I do not find it too salty at all as others have mentioned in their reviews.  It is a quick and delicious lunch or supper when I am just to lazy to cook.  Dish up with some sourdough bread and homemade butter; simply delicious.  So far this is the best price I have found for this soup too (at least when I purchased it).  I have checked other websites and my local stores.,X_train
4034,"I was looking for something special and unusual in the honey department. This was fantastic. The taste is so rich and unique, I feel that the price was well worth the amount (generous). I find myself loving this in stronger teas such as Earl Gray since it holds its own beautifully and compliments the classic taste.It will be hard for me to go back to more traditional honeys and I will keep this stocked in my pantry. I can't wait to share it with guests.",X_train
4035,"Nice Laksa taste here...on the shrimpy side smell-wise. No MSG or preservatives.<br /><br />Each box makes about three cups of broth, enough for a big bowl of delicious noodle soup! However, the nutritional info on the the box says it serves nine. That's at a rate of 2 Tbsps per serving (510 mg Sodium or 21% recommended daily allowance) which isn't how Laksa has ever been served to me internationally in twenty years. Therefore, if one person consumes the soup in this box, the sodium intake is 189% RDA. That's almost twice what is recommended.<br /><br />If this is correct, a big bowl of this soup is unhealthy. Too bad because it tastes great.",X_train
4036,Good base of aromatics at a good price.  Beats the heck out of paying 6.99 for an ounce at the local grocery store.,X_train
4037,"I just received this as a shower gift, and it is -so- much larger than I thought when I registered for it.  Looking at the pictures on here, it's easy to think that these are short bottles and the box is about the size of a tissue box.  It is much bigger. <br /> <br />The bottles of soap and shampoo are full size bottles (five of them). After I took out the packing materials, I had room to add four receiving blankets, two hooded towels, and eight washclothes.  The friend who gave it to me said that I didn't need a baby bathtub because the storage tote these come in is big enough to bathe the baby in.  She's joking, of course, but it's is not much smaller. <br /> <br />I can see quite a few uses for this tote once the baby years are over.  All in all, a fantastic gift.",X_train

I believe it is thanks to the high contrast black/white as well as the facial features - both of which are fascinating to newborns.

4048,Battery stopped charging after 6 months use. Unit wont work plugged in if battery wont charge. I emailed for help with our 1 year warranty. Got a response 9 days later giving a long process of how to get the warranty fulfilled. Can't go without a baby monitor for that long. Bought another monitor that works while plugged in without batteries and runs off of aaa batteries so you can actually get a replacement if needed (graco brand). They don't have rechargeable batteries on their website for sale even. Wasted my money on this. Products may be ok for summer infant but without reliable customer service the warranty is useless.

4053,"I have to agree with the other reviews at this point in time. As much as my son likes the looks of it, it collapses if tugged on. If you look closely in the picture at the clamps it shows you have to tighten them with a notch. It's not a simple clamp on/clamp off. The bar also can be moved forward or backward once on something so he can kick it from upright to down, or pull it into his face. He wasn't able to pull the string for music until he was 5 months because you have to pull pretty hard. I will say I love the look & I know he does too. I just wish it was designed better. The music also makes him smile because it's a different jingle then the one before. I don't recommend this toy bar. I wouldn't have bought it myself if I had looked closer at how this one actually attaches to objects.",X_train
4054,"This is the best! I love having this in the morning, it really helps. It does fall apart, but that gets me something to actually chew on during work. I think everyone who wants to stay awake should have a can of Major League! It's the bee's knee's!",X_train

There are no false alarms, no clip on sensors, no wires of any sort....just the most common sense engineering approach for sleep monitoring and the cleanest execution on the hardware I have ever seen.<br /><br />The baby is simply placed to sleep on a thin padded mat filled with fiber optic filaments (which somehow sense the tiny chest movements associated with inhaling and exhaling) and every single breath is counted and reported back to either a hand held monitor or to your smart phone via Bluetooth.  If the baby's breathing rate starts to slow, an alarm is sounded and sent to you BEFORE the baby stops breathing.  In addition, when using the smart phone software, you can track sleep patterns over time and review them to note any unusual sleep interruptions.  Somehow, the unit can even sense the difference between when your baby is lying quietly awake versus actually sleeping and report THAT back to you as well.  It is super cool.<br /><br />I had previously tried several different breath monitoring devices and these were simply not in the same league as this one...not even close.  The very simple design of the sleep mat combined with the straight forward software makes this product incredibly easy to use and (again...unlike competing products) there is actually monitoring of every breath and virtually ZERO false alarms.<br /><br />If you are concerned about SIDs and are searching for an infant breathing monitor, then this really is the ONLY product you should seriously consider.<br /><br />P.S.  There are some other bonus features which are kind of neat as well, including the presence of a small audio monitor which allows you to hear what is going on in the baby's room and even play soft music from your smart phone's play-list BACK TO the baby via a tiny speaker in the sleep mat, if you so choose !!!  Just one of the cool engineering details from the maker's of this product.",X_train

4069,"Traveling world wide, I've come to much prefer good tea to bad coffee, and good teas are so much more common. <br /> <br />Yellow Label is one of the most popular teas in the world because it has a rich, clean flavor without bitterness.  Its clear distinctive red color makes it also one of the prettiest.  The only supermarket teas I've found in the US that taste similar are the \\""English Breakfast\\"" labels.  If you like these, or like strong black tea flavor without the bitterness or muddiness of overbrewing the usual black teas, you should try Yellow Label.",X_train
4070,"I was excited to receive this mobile.  My ds wouldn't sleep in his crib, and after reading the reviews I thought- this is it, lull him to sleep with this entrancing mobile.  I took it out of the package and quickly ran upstairs to attach it to the crib.  Unfortunately, it only fits in one direction, and because our crib is curvy and thick- and wasn't going to work.  But, I was desperate- &#34;this was it&#34; I needed my ds to sleep!  So... we crafted up a stand with 4x4's and up went the mobile (slightly tacky but for a good cause).  At first ds didn't care for it, the light was too bright for nigh time.  However, I worked it into the routine before bed.  Every night we push the same button, we rock in the chair, and then I put ds in his crib to watch the mobile.  Beautiful!  Then, one night we were rocking and I looked up to see the mobile frozen.  The music was going, but it wasn't peek-a-booing or spinning.  So I quickly assumed the batteries were dying.  After replacing the batteries and screwing it back together everything worked again.  Until the next night, yup- frozen again.  I guess the leaves are just to heavy to play peek-a-boo every night.  I purchased this mobile when my son was 3 months, he was 6 months when the mobile started freezing on us.",X_train

We have been using these bags now for several months and they have maintained the quality.  We have one in the diaper bag, one in the swim bag, and my husband uses one in his gym bag. In all uses that work great and help limit the smell from those stinky diapers and gym clothes! Also they are definitely sealed very well.

I was pretty disappointed but new it was covered under warranty so I really didn't want to throw alot of money into anything.

I'm a first time mom and have heard pretty bad things about manual pumps however the reviews of this one were decent and for $15, I thought what the hell and I'm so glad I did! I have no problems or struggles with breastfeeding let me say that but this is perfect and better than I imagined, now I don't leave home without it! Its simple, easy to clean and actually works really well. We do a bunch of traveling and this is fabulous I just pump under my sweater and hand the bottle to my baby, I don't have to worry about a cooler or heating up the bottle or anything! Its been really fabulous and now knowing all this if something were to happen to mine id absolutely spend the full price and get the same one. Is it a little more effort? yes but you're manually pumping of course it will be! I don't normally write reviews but this product has made me want to try more nuk products. Overall like I said perfect travel pump!!",X_train

The gymini keeps his attention for a much longer time frame. I can easily change out toys so to him it is a new toy everyday. Also the attachments have been easy to find in a variety of stores and are not very expensive. The gymini stores simply and quickly by folding it, snapping it, and setting it against a wall, behind a chair, in his closet, etc. I have also had good luck traveling with the gymini as it doesn't take up much room and is lightweight enough to carry while juggling a baby and diaper bag. Another great feature has been the ease with which I can detach the mat and wash it - hasn't stained and comes out looking just as good as when I bought it. <br /> <br />I have recommened this particular gymini and Tiny Love products in general to several family members and friends.",X_train

I'm positive this will hold up for years.",X_train
4087,"I used to love Good Earth tea, they were my favorite brand. I love the use of fruit oils to flavor tea and give it a natural sweetness. However, now they added stevia to their teas. These new flavors are over the top sweet. I like to add honey or sugar to my tea, but this tea is over the top, tastes like cheap candy, sweet before adding anything. If you iced this tea and gave it to someone to taste I really don't think they would even be able to tell it's tea. It tastes more like an energy drink.<br /><br />I also don't like the number of ingredients, and seeing weird ingredients. The pomegranate flavor has corn starch in it!<br /><br />If you really don't like tea, like really sweet things, and want to drink tea because it's healthy or you just don't like coffee, then maybe you would like this.

Given what is going on in our food industry, I will not purchase any more products from this company.  It is to scary when feeding a baby.  Amazon refunded me but did not take it any further.  Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE:  I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earth's Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.  They have come to my house and written a report.  If anyone else noticed this problem please contact the USDA (1-888-674-6854).  to report your claim/problem.

You just put a spoon-full in a glass of juice (Don't use a glass of water...), then wait about 15-30 minutes (or longer), then get a straw and drink up! It actually adds to the experience of drinking juice. It's like drinking the little balls in boba tea, just something you can eat while drinking.

4164,"After weeks of researching stollers, we bought this one because it is cute, got great reviews and seemed to fill all our check boxes.  HOWEVER, what nobody has mentioned is that this stroller is always in a reclining position.  There is no way to make it sit up straight.  This means that my son is always sliding down against the single crotch strap.  He cannot sit up properly in this stroller and we wind up readjusting him every few minutes until he's had enough and starts screaming.  We have not even once made it more than 10-15 minutes with my son in this stroller, usually less.  And can you blame him?  Nobody wants to have a 1 1/2\\"" strap binding your diaper.  I cringe each time my husband puts this thing in the car as I know I'll end up carrying my 30 pound son and pushing this bulky stroller around with all our bags in the seat to keep it from tipping over backward.  It does have good maneuverability, if you use 2 hands but it is hard to push with just one.  Not a good buy.",X_train

Yes - it is much more expensive, but totally worth it.  After using the Medela for a few weeks, I tried this pump again and it still hurt and barely pumped anything.  I agree that the suction is just not right.  While I do love all of the other products I have from Avent - I really feel that this pump was a waste of money.",X_train

4168,First off the Jelly Belly Jelly Beans are great in taste and it is fun trying to guess which flavor you have.  You could use the chart on the jar to tell you the flavor but what would be the fun in that.  The price is great as I paid $10.00 at the local candy store for one pound.  In fact they took them from the same jar that is pictured above.<br /><br />  There is only one thing missing. A candy dish for the coffee table.  I check Amazon for a candy dish and found a real nice one shaped like a Hershey's Kiss.  It was cut crystal and fit my coffee table well.<br /><br />  My neighbors come visit me more often now and don't leave till they hit the candy dish at least once.  Now that could be good or bad depending what your neighbors are like.<br /><br />  So I guess all that is unanswered is: Will they ever come out with the 50th flavor? (my cat is suggesting Fish flavor but don't listen to him).,X_train
4169,"I purchased this along with several other brands when my daughter was about 6 months old as she was transitioning diaper sizes and I wanted one that would grow with her. We use the standard cotton prefolds with a GroVia liner to catch the mess. The incredibum has plenty of adjustments as well as flaps on the inside front and back that cover the top of the prefold. The fabric is pliable and soft and leg gussets are good, although we are mostly over any blowouts I think this would keep them in if fitted tight enough. We are able to reuse them for several changes, which is nice.<br /><br />She is now 10 months old and on the tall and skinny side (29\\"" tall and 17.5 lbs). The rise is fine (we are on the middle row of button) but she is in between the two snaps that affect the leg and waist closure. So either her leg holes are a little loose or the top has a bit of a gap. I prefer to keep the legs on the tighter setting to avoid leaking, and the inside flaps do seem to prevent any leaking out the top.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a good product and would recommend.",X_train

4254,"The Elegant Baby line of soft bath toys are of great quality. These toys, in particular, are brightly colored and have wonderful detail (considering that they are made of soft plastic). I have avoided allowing the children to play with them in the tub, however, as there have been numeroud reports about mold growing inside of the toys since one cannot completely empty/dry the inside of the toy.

Even vigorous fermentation of a 5-gallon batch does not reach the airlock.    What kind of sucks is Amazon's labeled shipping.  This says it is Prime Eligible in both the general search results and in the product description, but when you go to checkout nothing but standard shipping can now be selected.  I say \\""now\\"" as I had ordered one a couple weeks ago and could select Prime shipping even though it did not show as such on the receipt.  I got the carboy on the second day.    When I went back to order a second the Prime option was nowhere to be found.  When I called Amazon the rep told me it was not eligible and she would have their programming team remove the indicator.  One and a half weeks later it still shows.    So to summarize, carboy good, Amazon weak.",X_train

4280,"We received this at our baby shower, and when my son was 3.5 months old I got it out, put it together and started putting my son in it for brief periods. He is now 5 months old, and this toy NEVER gets old! He loves it! I love the Exersaucer because it is great to put him in when I need to cook, clean, etc...I don't have to worry about him rolling or crawling away from his blanketed play area while there are things I need to do. Its also great to use if you want to watch a movie...I just pull it next to the couch, and ever so often talk to him and help him play with the toys, by doing this I can enjoy a movie with my husband, keep my son entertained(the entire movie), and not feel like I am ignoring my son. It isn't as hard as it seems to put together, except for that rattle roller with the monkey's in it...It was a pain to get on, lol! I put it together rather quickly. The toys on it are all interesting...he loves when the Circus Tent plays music and I sing along. The little &#34;book&#34; is always interesting to him, whether I am reading it to him, or he's flipping the pages by himself. Sometimes, he gets really interested in the roller rattle...he'll spin it and spin it, and lean in close to study the monkey's bananas, and beads in it. The other toys are basically just teethers, he loves to move the balls on the seal toy, and the elephant is his favorite toy(he is always playing with it, chewing it, and holding it). The snack tray, which we don't use for snacks yet, is great for holding a pacifer. This past weekend we went to my mother in law's to spend the night, and I decided to take the Exersaucer. It is easy to collapse, easy to carry, and travels well. My son and I really recommend this toy! In fact, his granny(who will be babysitting when I go back to work) just bought the Wild Thing Exersaucer...which he'll probably love also.",X_train

4289,"I have always been a big fan of the Kraft grated cheddar cheese. The kind that comes with their macaroni and cheese dinners, and used to be available in containers. They vanished from stores years ago, and they used to sell it in small 3 oz shakers by the case here on Amazon, but that too has since disappeared.  Unfortunately grated cheddar is very expensive as compared to the standard Romano or Parmesan.  The Kraft was worth the extra cost for it was so delicious.  But the others I have tried have either been way to expensive, or weak and flavorless.  This Hoosier cheddar blend is not as strong nor as flavorful as the Kraft by any means in my opinion.  But it is still very good, and excellently priced.  Unlike many on here, I don't use it much on popcorn.  I love it on pasta especially, and when making my home made pizzas.  It is also very tasty in soups as well.  It is indeed unfortunate that the Kraft grated cheddar is not available anymore, but this is a very worthy alternative, especially for the price.  Not quite as good as Kraft, but still decent and recommended... : )<br /><br />PS:  At the time of this writing, the 1 1/2 pound size is a much better bargain over the one pound container.  It's just around $3.00 more and you get another half pound of product.  Also, I was originally sent a one pound container by mistake, but the seller allowed me to keep it and promptly sent me the correct larger size. : )",X_train

4301,"I really wanted to like this stroller.  And for the most part I have, but there are a few problems that I've had that I think those looking to purchase would like to know.<br />First of all, I've had the stroller for about 6 months now and I use it every day. It is very lightweight and easy to fold and put in a trunk.  Now on to the bad stuff...<br />1.  About three times now the stroller has become unusable and unsafe because a nut from a screw (not the same one each time) has fallen off.  Once this happened  while going through airport security.  Luckily, the security guard found the nut on the floor and reattached it for me.  The last time this happened I got out my screwdriver and proceeded to try and tighten all the screws.  Because of the way the stroller is constructed it is nearly impossible to tighten them all the way.  <br />2.  The attachment for the canopy broke one day and I had to get it replaced.  <br />3.  My daughter never really seems to be comfortable in her stroller.  She's always slouched with her legs hanging off the side of the stroller.  And this causes the harness to rub her neck until it is red.  <br />4.  I have an overall complaint about the craftmanship and quality of the stroller.  I can wiggle the handles of the stroller and the whole stroller creaks up and down.  It causes me to wonder how long I will be able to use it before it really just falls apart.",X_train

4316,"This monitor worked out very well in my home. I never had any problem with this monitor as far as not being able to hear my child or having the vibration brake (my husband used it often with the vibration mode on). It did somewhat eat up the batteries if used remote frequently or with the vibration mode on (a cell phone will do the same if in the vibrate mode). On an occassion or two it did pick up whole phone conversations (when my neighbor used a cordeless phone)in my immediate area. We just switched channels. It is a monitor that uses frequencies so if you think about it, it really shouldn't be unexpected to have run into this problem a time or two. If it happened more often and you couldn't change channels I could see switching to a 2.4 or something. The only time it became a problem to own this monitor is when we moved. The only thing I could get was static. However, I moved to a new development where homes are still being built which may or may not have something to do with the problem. I also moved across country and had a moving company pack some of our belongings. It's very possible it just got damaged in the move.

4331,"After our Diaper Genie broke, I really wanted a diaper pail that took regular trash bags, and that contained the poopy diaper smell better.  Overall, this is a so-so diaper pail. It looks nice.  But like other reviewers have mentioned, if the trash bag is too full, it will snag on the inner lip of the pail.  This hasn't been a real problem for me.  My major problem with this diaper pail is that it doesn't contain the smell of soiled diapers very well at all- poopy or just urine-soiled.  For $79, I was expecting this to work a lot better than it does.  I have to change the bag every other day just to keep the smell from becoming totally overwhelming.  Also as others have mentioned, the stink is very potent when you first open the top of the pail to drop in a diaper.  Unfortunately, the smell definitely lingers after the top is closed.  I close the top as fast as possible, too, and the smell still escapes.  And the can itself does absorb odor, or at least mine does.  The empty diaper pail reeks of soiled diapers for quite awhile after I take out the bag.<br /><br />I wish I had better things to say about this diaper pail, but alas I do not.  I honestly think the Diaper Genie was better at containing the smell.  And I didn't have to change the bag as frequently.  A regular trash can would work just as well as this diaper pail.  I've had this pail for several months now, too, and have tried everything to keep the smell at bay.  I may just have to change the bag every day or multiple times a day, but then am I really saving money on bags???<br /><br />Oh, and your toddler can definitely open this pail and get to the dirty diapers.  The top opening on the lid does lock, but there is no lock for the actually lid, which you have to lift up to remove the bag. My 15 month year old figured this out after watching me take out a bag of dirty diapers.<br /><br />At the end of the day, if you want a nice looking diaper pail, then this one is great.  If you want one that indeed contains the smell & is completely child-proof, keep looking.",X_train

It looks beautiful.",X_train
4353,"Awful. Just awful.    Purchased online for my 25 month old and my newborn. My older child didn't fit into the seat from DAY ONE (and we purchased from a site that had no return option). His knees were up towards his chest and the sunshade is so low that we couldn't put it up at all, as his head would be pressing into it. He was only 25 months old and 29 lbs! They say up to 45 lbs - to me, that's insanity at best and at worst a bad lie - no 45 lb child would be able to use this, seriously.  As for the newborn, you can recline the backseat all the way, but then the teeny-tiny sunshade doesn't protect them at all, so we had to spend MORE money on a separate sunshade that means we can't see him while pushing and it has to be untied to get him out from behind the front seat.     It's much heavier than it looks, and with the heavier child over the single wheel in front, it always wants to tip when turning corners.    The basket is virtually useless because you can't get to it. I have actually scraped the skin on the back of my hand trying to squeeze something in there.    PLEASE try and look at one rather than buying online sight unseen, because I really believe you will see that it's a waste.    We ended up going to a store in desperation and buying another $300 cheap-plastic combi double side-by-side that is flimsy and unsteady and I hate pushing, but at least the children can sit comfortably and recline and sleep in it.    p.s. we had the Bugaboo Frog for our firstborn and miss it so, so much, so for me it's not about the price - we were willing to spend more for quality. This is just a poor product.",X_train
4354,"Uniqueness of Liuan Guapian Green Tea<br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />Liuan Guapian (Melon Slice) green tea is one of China's top 10 green teas. The dried leaves are a rich, dark green color, rolled slightly lengthwise, measuring about 1 inch in length. Infused the color of the tea liquid is yellow with a green tint to it. The smell is a green, vegetal smell, fresh and sweet, with a suggestion of seaweed (which to our minds means healthy). The taste is similar: refreshing, vegetal, healthy. The aftertaste is pleasant, lingering, decided but also subtle.<br /><br />Liuan Guapian green tea originated in Anhui province in the early part of the Qing Dynasty (1636-1910 CE) and was a tribute tea to the emperor. After the leaves are picked, the bud and stem are removed, leaving the top two first leaves only, which are pan-fried over a low heat in small amounts (about 150 grams at a time).

4374,"I ordered this after reading the reviews about the pails arriving broken. I took a chance and it worked out okay. Mine was cracked a little on the lid but the salt remained in the container (for the most part..). This required me to swap out containers, but that was not a real problem either as I had a large food-grade plastic bucket available. So..I guess I was luckier than some.<br /><br />I am immensely pleased with the salt. The quality is high and the taste is very \\""clean\\"". It is a LOT of salt, but if you use a lot, it will work out well for you. I have given up on salt from the grocery for the most part. I much prefer this over the \\""table salt\\"" available. I use this exclusively for cooking in place of \\""kosher\\"" salt. I also put some in a grinder for use on the table. It has become my \\""everyday\\"" go to salt.<br /><br />Another great use is salt-crusting. This amount of salt allows you to use a couple of cups occasionally, moistened and packed over and around fish (typically..) before baking. You can also make a \\""salt dough\\"" with the addition of a little flour and use it to wrap around chicken before baking. There are a lot of uses for salt and this amount and quality and price allows you to use some of it without too much guilt.<br /><br />Shipping is the only issue. I think the product is packaged by the supplier in a manner that is okay if palletized and shipped by truck. When these pails are handled by warehouse staff and small-lot shippers (UPS, FedEx, USPS, etc..) is where the problems occur. Amazon needs to handle and package this product in a different manner to allow undamaged delivery to the customer.<br /><br />Five stars for a superior product and great value.

4385,"I am in LOVE with this chair! It looks great, wipes clean easily and is adjustable to grow with your child! I got this chair right before my daughter's first birthday, originally I had purchased the Svan Anka High Chair which was horrible on so many levels, I reviewed it as well if you'd like to read that review, and only gave it 1 star. This chair has the best of both worlds in regards to from and function, I love the look of the wooden legs and that baby can't reach them to get them dirty! It is sturdy and durable but light enough to be moved into another room. The tray is very big and holds a good amount of spilled liquid. Though this tray is dish washer safe on the top rack I haven't found a need to do that, anything that hasn't come off with a wet paper towel I can clean in the sink with warm water, soap and a songe. The foam pads are velcroed on, stay put when you need them and can be removed easily for a thorough cleaning but most days all I need to do is spray the tray and wipe down the cushions! My old chair required some elbow grease to get it clean, not really ideal when you have toddler that runs away as soon as you take them out of the chair ;)  The starps are adjustable, as were the ones on my old highchair, but these shoulder starps come off to be washed if your child gets food on them (the middle lower strap is not removable however), my old chair the only way to do that would be to disassemble the chair, which is kinda rediculous! Yes this chair is more expensive than Fisher Price and Graco, but I compared it to Peg Perego and Boon which are even priceier and this one was the best choice since the other ones aren't functional for older childern.

Very easy install - maybe they could make the wall brackets out of metal instead of plastic - they flex a bit when the gate is being pulled on by my baby - but not a significant issue or concern.,X_train

With all other tea I've purchased in 20 count boxes, the bags came individually wrapped in metallic packages. These bags are loose in the box without any wrappers.  They're all hooked together like sausage links, and as stated in the description they have no strings.  So you have to fish them out of your tea cup with a spoon.        If they were individually wrapped and had strings, they'd be 5 star IMO.  And if you use Amazon's \\""suscribe and save\\"", not only will this be cheaper, but shipping will always be free.

4414,"Tuscan milk is the greatest drink on the planet.  When my house was robbed, it lept from my fridge, flexed it's calcium-enhanced biceps, and proceeded to help the burglars run off with my large appliances.  They would have never managed to lift that 1970s Magnavox all by themselves.    When the police arrived, it single handedly stole all their underware, and left it in a moist pile by my porch.    FUN FACT ABOUT TUSCAN WHOLE MILK:    From July 17, 1999, through June 18, 2004, there were 57 school-associated Tuscon Milk uses in the United Kingdom. Thirty-eight of these acts resulted in homicides, and six were regicides. Twelve of the thirty-eight school-associated Tuscon Milk uses involved pupils local to the incidents.  The rest of the atrocities were commited by gangs of asian catgirls, who were later run down by Maury Povich. These twelve Tuscon Milk uses are actually a small percentage of the total of thirteen-billion children ages 4-89 who were victims of first-degree milkings over the same period. Six of the Six school-associated regicides from July 17, 1999, through June 18, 2004, involved metal tigers. Not in the classroom, there were a total of twelve regicides commited by children rated 14+ by the ESRB.",X_train

The mechanism for opening is difficult enough that a child can't do it, although easy enough for a parent carrying a child to do one-handed without any strain. The height is great, my 18 month old is off the charts in height but this still stops him in his tracks. No lower rungs means he can't scale it, should he try. We've bought three of these.<br />Install is simple. Can be done by one but is made infinitely easier with a helping hand.<br />The extensions are sturdy, even when you have to use all of them (I was worried they might wobble, but they don't). We are in a rental and did not want to damage the walls so we only used the pressure mounting option and it's still great. We have one at the grandparents' house actually, that even fits at the bottom of a staircase.. huge plus!<br />Overall, fantastic.

I say ALMOST because desperation produces creative approaches to eating even the most frozen pint.<br /><br />I love this stuff, and I would eat any of the flavors.  However, the CHOCOLATE and CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER are the best-tasting.<br /><br />Don't expect ARCTIC ZERO to taste like the 800-calories/pint ice creams.

The Munchkin one still looks as good as the day we got it, so we're in the process of swapping over to all Munchkin ones. We don't use the rubber stoppers anymore, so the cup can leak if turned over, but that is part of the cost of not having the stopper on them so our son can get the full flow of milk or juice, but when we did use the rubber stopper and he'd tip the Munchkin cup we'd get a very very slow dribble through the vent hole, nothing that was uncontrollable though. We do prefer the Munchkin over the Playtex now just because of the durability. And in case you don't know, when ordering these you'll get a RANDOM selection!

I wouldn't suggest it for accompanying heavy meals, like a steak dinner or anything like that. The light taste would get lost in the meals bolder flavors. But I love having one of these with a bagel for breakfast or with a sandwich at lunch. The flavor is light, and it isn't too sweet. Nothing like a sports drink or juice. It reminds me of distilled water, with just a bit of a background taste.

4457,"Here's all the timer simply does:  There are 4 buttons (diaper, feed, sleep and multipurpose).  When you do the activity, hit the button and it starts timing upwards so that you can tell how long \\""itzbeen\\"" since the last time you did each activity.  There is a separate timer readout for each activity.  Hitting the button when you do the activity resets the timer back to zero.    But you will still need to record history! It will help monitor trends (at least in the beginning anyways)!  It will help you notice patterns and spot things out of the norm.    Feedings:    You will need to track history and record how many feedings (and also how long they breast fed or how much they bottle fed).  Then you can tell how much your baby is eating and average how far apart. Helpful to spot cluster feeds.    Diapers:  You will need to record if its a wet diaper or dirty or both.  The timer just records how long its been between a diaper change and not a difference with pee or poo.   (I guess you could use the multipurpose button for poo).      Sleeping:  Truthfully we didn't use this timer that much.  The baby usually ate, diaper changed, and then slept.  We didn't bother recording this and woke him up regardless (if he was sleeping) according to feeding schedule.    Other features:  Clock - just about the only feature we use.  Night light - too small to really do anything.  Breast tracking - a toggle switch to track which breast you last fed.  Somewhat useful. But not used anymore (after 2 months).    I might use this later on when the baby is possibly older and just monitor the last times of each activity.  But seeing its my first kid, I will probably track stuff on paper for awhile.      Overall, you're better off with pen, paper and a clock.  Buy yourself a nice clock instead.",X_train

This isn't. It has a wee bit of 'fat' that the other doesn't but it doesn't seem to be affecting my cholesterol numbers or weight...<br /><br />I do think it tastes better, gets 'tender' faster (reconstitutes easier) and is a little less off feeling in the mouth (texture) than the TVP. I measure it with a 1/8 cup stainless coffee scoop, and consider 2 heaping scoops a daily serving of protein. Heat 1/4 cup of water to boiling, add a teaspoon of your boullion if you want to flavor it (1/2 to 1 teaspoon) then after that dissolves put in the TSP and let soak for a few minutes. Or add right into your soup or stew at the end of cooking. These are about twice the price of TVP but I think they are much better for me, and a 4 pack runs about two months at that size serving for one. The individual bags are a bit bigger than a similar bag of TVP as well. One will fit nicely poured into a 1/2 gallon sealed container.  Subscribe and it is cheaper, I like that. The hard part is to figure out how much and how often to set up your subscription for.<br /><br />They have also made good pizza toppings and taco and burrito filler. For pizza I will reconstitute and sprinkle across the pizza right after the sauce and before other toppings, so it's in there being a 'meat' layer. I have not found a binder that will keep it in burger or meatball form that I can eat (the binder) so I treat this as a loose ground meat fake. It will be a very light colored loose ground meat fake, is a drawback if you are really trying to fake 'meat'. As a 'protein source' instead, it's wonderful.",X_train

4491,"This isn't necessarily low-carb, but for primal/paleo folks and gluten free- folks, this is a winner. I make mine without cheese in the crust, as it is optional.<br /><br />It took me a few tries to get it right because I stink at cooking, and I learned the hard way that you should NOT broil this for too long. That aside, the recipe is very easy: Mix + 2 large eggs + Oil (I use EVOO), and some shredded cheese if you desire.<br /><br />Even though you could put the pizza toppings on at the same time that it cooks, I found that I liked it better by cooking it for half the time (it doesn't need long to cook), and then adding the toppings.<br /><br />The bread itself is a bit different at first, crunchy/firm on the outside, but soft and somewhat gooey (but not nasty at all) on the inside. It's really delicious even on its own.<br /><br />I would consume this in moderation but daily if you wanted; I had a pizza binge with one box and it went right through me.

I'm not sure if she could actually propel herself completely out of the chair, but it made us really nervous and we wouldn't leave her in the chair without having our eyes on her and being within arms reach at all times.

I think that contributes to their enthusiasm when first seeing this Prince Lionheart YoMOTO Ride-on bike. The sleek, low-slung, cool shape, accompanied by the design of the blue trim (comes in red too), resembles a racing vehicle. What kid could resist?    Looks aside, this is a sturdy toy that the kids enjoy. Aside from having a bit of trouble placing their feet properly and leaning \\""the right way\\"" for balance, the kids soon found their \\""groove\\"" and are now fighting over it. I notice the ones past two years of age have the least difficulty in maneuvering it, so it might be best to wait till your child reaches that age.    Fun aside, on the practical side, it's a great way to learn balance and an easy step towards learning to ride a two-wheel bike. Another practical thing I like is the easy assembly; just snap the handlebars on and your kid is set to go.    Some parents are suggesting a helmet, just in case, so that might be a good idea until your child is used to his new learning toy.    Highly recommended.

One is a single trip bag to haul to diapers and such, and the other is overnight size for clothes.Together they are baby's luggage :-) Two reasons that I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

It is annoying to keep rewinding the mobile, but I prefer that to buying and constantly replacing batteries. I had three different mobiles--one for crib, one for changing table and one for his crib at grandma's. This one was by far our favorite. I suspect that all the broken mobile issues were due to user error--probably over-winding to make the music last longer. I never overwound the mobile and never had any issues. We have been using it for over 7 months. I took it out of the crib once my son could pull himself up, but we keep it in a corner of his room so he can still look at it. I'm glad I ignored the bad reviews and took a chance with this sweet little mobile!",X_train

4612,"We purchased these straps to hold the toilet lid down, so the rug rat can't fall in.  They don't work, the sticky pads pull right off with little effort AND the latching mechanism was much too difficult to open.  So, I modified them by removing plastic from the raised portion of the latch using a razor blade, so they now open easier.  Next, I removed the sticky tape that came with the latch and replaced it with some Scotch 4010 strong 2 sided sticky tape.  I wouldn't go to all this effort to hold the toilet seat down, but the other mechanical arm devices are made so poorly that I don't like them - they are hard to use and subject to kids ripping them off.  So, we'll try to see if this strapping hold down will work with better tape.<br />Overall, a good product idea, but very poorly designed.",X_train

4620,"I ordered this mattress cover about a month ago.  I have a 9 month old who for the last couple of months has been insisting on drinking a lot of formula right before bedtime (6 - 10 oz a night).  We switched to overnight diapers thinking that that would do the trick, but she's leaking through her diapers when she sleeps 11 or 12 hours a night.  Originally I was using a mattess pad that covered the majority of the mattress.  I was using it also to work with the pack-n-play.  Learned pretty quickly that the pad wasn't holding all of the moisture.  Then I went to a big box store and purchased a mattress cover that I figured would work (for approx $11).  When I opened the package I was surprised to see that the liner backing was explosed on the underneath and then in my pre-wash the lining was cracked in various places.  I read the reviews on this mattress pad and decided to give it a try. I loved how the lining wasn't exposed at all, I could tell this product had quality immediately.  But.. the big test was yesterday when I was changing my daughter's diaper in her crib.  Before I could get a new diaper underneath her, she urinated on the sheet.  I actually let her finish before removing her, as I wanted to test the cover (normally I would never do that!).  I put one of those puppy pads under her to keep her dry and changed her clothes while she laid over the wet spot (so the spot sat there for about 5-7 minutes with baby's weight on it).  After handing baby over to daddy so that I could change the sheets, I was thrilled to see that this cover passed the test with flying colors!  Absolutely NO leaking through!  I'm planning to buy more and will probably order more for baby shower gifts too!<br /><br />***********************************************************<br /><br />Update 10/16/12:  I now own 3 of these pads to rotate easily in the week if necessary.  My third pad ripped (the pad separated from the fitted side section).  Ripped about 4 inches along the seam.  I was disappointed, but it still was functional, so I'm still using it with absolutely no problems!",X_train

You gotta love that stage in life.<br /><br />I like that this is a glass bottle as it doesn't stain when we offer colored beverages. The unit has a silicone base that can be removed for cleaning. The handles and top/ring can be placed on the top rack in the dishwasher but I usually just wash them and allow to air dry. I like running the bottle through the dishwasher to make sure it is clean and germ free.<br /><br />Overall, this is a super cute bottle with an adorable frog climbing the side. The unit comes with an extra nipple and we have been able to get the sippy disks that fit jars to work too.<br /><br />This would be a cute gift for a baby shower or new parent basket.

This was important because the larger nipples made it seem as though the baby was choking on the milk because it was coming out much to quickly.

Pros first: the table looks sturdy and of good quality, in spite of the scratches and dents (probably from shipping? looks antique though, we'll say). It came with directions, which is always nice. It shipped to an FPO address! Thanks for that! Cons: one shelf support was split before I was even done putting it together. I had an extra #1 screw and was short a #2, not that it matters b/c three of the holes aren't taking the screws anyway.

She doesn't seem to care about the vibration mode, but maybe she will when she's a bit older.  She's in it so much that the songs have haunted me at night and in the shower, I guess that happens to all parents though.

It is a very cheaply manufactured product that should never be sold for a children's room.  The drawers fall apart every time you open them because the pieces don't lock together correctly.  When trying to get the company to send replacement parts, they refused to respond.  After sending a dozen emails and constantly calling, it took them 8 months to finally respond, just to send more cheap materials. And the bottom of the drawer is nothing but a thin piece of board that barely holds clothes.  This is not something you want in a child's room where they can really hurt themselves. The dresser looks nice but it is complete crap.  It scratches and marks very easily. Go with better quality furniture, your child's life is at risk!",X_train

The two selling points on this highchair were that a.) it has a compact fold b.) the tray lid is removable and dishwasher safe.  The trendy seat cover was an added bonus.

4673,"This brush works really well for me.  I used to use the full cylindrical style brush and had the same complaints as others with splashing everywhere when you pull this type back out of the bottle.  The shape of the bristles definitely reduce the amount of splattering.  The fact that the bristles aren't in a full cylinder, does not at all compromise the effectiveness of cleaning the inside of the bottle.  In fact, they tend to conform much better than the cylindrical style.<br /><br />In addition, I actually don't have any AVENT bottles.  I use it for plastic & glass Medela bottles and glass Dr. Brown's bottles.  No problems fitting.<br /><br />The only obvious downside is no suction cup or anything to stand it upright.  I usually have the bottles soaking in a bowl before cleaning, and so I just rest this brush across the container in between cleaning one bottle and the next.",X_train

The video quality is nice and we have no issues seeing her when it is dark in her room etc.   I love every thing about the monitor EXCEPT the battery life. As long as we keep the hand held unit plugged in there are no issues. But unplug it for 5 minutes and we start getting the battery warning light and it will shut off shortly after. Not acceptable since we keep the unit plugged in 99.9% of the day. Being winter, it hasnt caused much of an issue yet but with spring/summer approaching we will be outside more and I expect this to be an issue. I have contacted Safety 1st to see if they have any suggestions. If not I may do some research and consider purchasing another monitor that can hold a charge.

Thus when looking for a convertible seat, we naturally first thought of Britax again, but looked at others as well.  There was no comparison in the convertible seats.  The quality of the Britax is just SOOOO much better.  Yes, it's more expensive, but isn't your baby worth it?!  Would definitely buy again.",X_train

4688,"You'll sleep like a baby, when you know your baby is sleeping safely. The ASTRA VIDEO MONITOR has got to be one of the coolest, most useful products I've EVER encountered. What you have here is an easy-to-use baby audio/video monitoring system, that lets you remotely watch your child's entire room, day or night, listen to them, speak to them, and even play soothing music for them.<br />THE VIDEO CAMERA<br /> The video camera has a zoom function, and can pan up, down, tilt right or left, all remotely controlled by the video screen hand helt device.  That camera will point just about anywhere you want it to in the room, 300 degrees horizonal and 110 degrees verticle, without making a sound. It has amazing night vision capacity. Even with next to NO LIGHT on, the night vision function let's you see the room and the baby (in black and white), just as clearly as if it were daylight. The picture quality resembles that of a good digital camera. During daylight use, the picture is in COLOR.<br />THE TWO WAY AUDIO<br />When your baby starts to cry, the LED light on the video screen turns from blue, to a flashing orange and green color. The menu allows you to sellect the sensitivity levels, so a random noise doesnt activate the LED indicator lights. Plus the video screen turns on when crying starts, if its turned off. You can sellect how loud you hear the baby cry, and you can also sellect MUTE. You can calm the baby down by talking into the viewscreen device, which transmits your voice over the video camera's built in speaker. My elderly mother is hard of hearing, but she could hear me, and make my words out quite well, when I spoke to her over the video monitor.<br />SIGNAL STRENGTH<br />The video camera has an antenna that transmits to the hand helt view screen. The signal strength is utterly amazing. I live in a brick home, and it transmitted thru the brick walls into the newer part of the house without problems. It transmitted from downstairs to upstairs, and across 4 rooms, without any problem. In fact, I took the monitor outside, and walked down the street---FIVE HOUSES AWAY-- and still had good signal strength. I see no reason why you shouldnt get good transmission from the video camera to the view screen, even if you're in the yard, or down in the cellar, and the baby's room is upstairs.<br />THE LULLABY FEATURE<br />If your baby calms down in response to music, you can direct the video camera to play one of three preprogrammed lullabies over the speaker. The sound is a bit mechanical, but no different than a baby's crib toy that you wind up to play a song. You push the MENU button, and then chose one of three songs. 1. Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. 2. Strauss Venanese Walze 3. Oh Johnny Boy (old irish tune)<br />EASE OF USE<br />The instructions are in easy to read, easy to understand english. You unpack it, insert and charge the battery, plug in the Video camera, turn it on, and it's working. If you want to get fancy, you can buy multiple video cameras, and have them all transmit to one view screen. It didnt even take me a minute to figure out how all this works. The feature design is very intuitive. You have the button you push to transmit your voice, the on/off switch on the side, the up/down/right/left arrows on the toggle button, just like on a DVD remote, to point the camera around. To transmit your voice you push a MIC button. You have the menu button, so you can adjust the sound sensitivity, the view screen brightness, chose the lullaby, etc. The view screen has various icons, that lets you know signal strength, if the battery is charged, if the MUTE is on, as well as every other possible function. The battery will operate for 48 hours between charges, if you use the \\""POWER SAVE\\"" mode. When the battery is low, the blue LED light flashes slowly. Believe me, the ASTRA monitor's use is very intuitive, and easy.<br />OVERALL IMPRESSION<br />I'm just so \\""WOWed\\"" by this baby monitor. The box comes with mounting hardware, so you can mount the camera up high on the wall. Maybe it wont matter with a baby, but if you want to put this in the kid's playroom, I'd mount it up on the wall. Since the camera will tilt up and down, swivel right to left, and zoom, you'll be able to remotely move the camera's lense to see the ENTIRE room, if its up in the corner. As long as kids dont play with this and break it, you'll be using this for years. The video camera and the view screen have a very modern style too, and are both VERY small. The round camera device is only about four and a half inches tall. If you have any problems understanding how your monitor works, or if its not working right, you can call up CUSTOMER SUPPORT--for as long as you own the device. In fact, there's a \\""panic button\\"" on the screen, which gives you their \\""800\\"" number, and webpage, so you dont have to go looking for the instruction manuel. With all the features, ease of use, excellent night vision and transmission range, I believe its well worth the money spent.ou can mount the camera up high on the wall.

4693,"The glowing reviews of these 'cakes' (in the loosest possible sense of the definition of cake) caused me to buy them along with an order of robust English tea (which in the event fully lived up to its definition of robust tea).<br />They looked a bit dodgy to me even as I looked at them in their individual plastic containers but trusting to the five star reviews I dove in.  These things are utterly horrible.  They are just mushy, mealy, sugar gut bombs that are so unpalatable that I thought I had eaten four of them and found the next day that I had three remaining.<br />After the first two, I thought that I should give them a fair shot at changing my initial revulsion and so went back and ate (as I thought) two more to confirm my worst fears.<br />These are frightfully bad.  So bad, in fact, that I had to read the contents just out of morbid curiosity.  Sure enough, apart from Wheat (proportionately the third most ingredient in the mix) these are nothing but sugar and fat: #1 Sugar #2 Vegetable Oils (fat) #4 Glucose Syrup (sugar) #5 Vegetable Glycerin (fat) #6 Vegetable fats (fat) #7 Dextrose (sugar) #8 Dried Egg White (finally something neither fat nor sugar) #9 Whey powder (Whoops, fat again) #10 Corn Starch.<br />There is no flavor to speak of, other than cloying sweet sugar burn and, as I said, the texture is mushy and mealy.<br /><br />I'm not a food snob.  I eat fast food often.  In fact I went to not one, not two, but THREE fast food joints today for coffee drinks and a fried fish sandwich.<br />I bought a lot of these as giveaways to customers because I thought they'd be a novel treat but I gotta say, I'm going to apologize as I leave them.  I have to imagine that we can make things that are every bit as loathsome right here in the USA.  I find that my guys like the cakes from Sara Lee, which are admittedly a bit much for me for pretty much the same reasons that I don't like these--only less so-- but I will eat one of those on occasion and sometimes almost enjoy it.njoy it.",X_train

4696,"I honestly came here to leave this review. I've always enjoyed a good black tea with milk and sugar. After having officially given up coffee, I've gone through my fair share of teas trying to find that perfect morning cup. I am by no means a connoisseur however and tea drinkers are passionate and use some verbiage that goes over my head when reading reviews. After drinking Twining's English & Irish Breakfast varieties, and several other brands of the same kind, I had given up finding something strong and smooth. They were either way too weak (tastes like watery milk even when only using a spot of milk) or too bitter. I forgot Tazo's Awake (English Breakfast) was brewing for a little over 5 min. and it was undrinkable. Searching here this came up finally. I put it in my cart and forgot about it. Lo and behold walking through one of my local discount markets (Reny's in Maine) ; you might find it in Job Lot, Dollar stores, etc, have no idea why; I found this for $3.99!! Thats the regular price, so Amazon is definitely way overpriced. I brewed one as soon as I got home and BOOM! Strong, malty , smooth and not a HINT of bitterness. In fact it matters not whether you leave it in 3 minutes or 10. The taste kind of plateaus out and I even walk around with the bag in my cup after adding milk and a few sugars. It's seriously good. I love the bag (same as pictured here) , reminds me of living in Ireland but the sticker will eventually give out (I have about 2 cups a day). Just as a measured experiment I brewed a Twinings Irish Breakfast yesterday and it was awful. Dreadfully weak after 9 minutes in the cup.

4706,"There are two reasons why I bought this chair for our baby.   1) At age 3 months, she is nearly 25\\"" and outgrew her regular bouncer already.   2) She has GERD (gasy, acid reflux), so I want something that sits more upright without putting a lot of pressure on her tummy    This is a great chair and meets all of my baby's needs. She had a great time bouncing herself at the high setting and nap soundly with the lower setting. Although her acid reflux is being controlled by medicine now, she is always happy sitting in this chair.     The only complain I have is difficulty to put her in the chair while I am alone. I usually try to slide her into the chair, but if her legs are not at the right position, the sliding doesnt really work and can become frastrating.

It feels great on the back, there is no mess, and its quick to apply on your skin. I have never been burned, even on days when I use it more then 4 times. It just gives a nice warm and soothing feel. It's very important never to apply it before a workout, somehow the sweat activates the Icy Hot even more and it really starts to get hot. It just doesn't bother me that much because my back is use to it. The 2.5 oz bottle last me around 2 months, that's a long time with how much I use it.

4710,"The Nosefrida works great for its intended use -- cleaning out your baby's nose. Two people really help, but it could be done by a persistent single parent, especially laying your infant on a changing table. You should disassemble the device and wash out the plastic tube with every use. I washed it with Diabetic Alcohol (91 percent), though I personally am not diabetic, to disinfect it. IMPORTANT: One must let it thoroughly dry due to fumes and/or rewash with water before the next use. I did not want to re-infect my infant with a prior illness.<br /><br />The problem, and I mean severe problem, quite nearly a health hazard, is that the Nosefrida will inoculate whoever is using it with the same illness that is sickening your child. A persistent user will apply strong vacuum to the device, and the filter, of course, is meant for capturing media and doesn't remove airborne germs. Every time a user breathes deeply using the Nosefrida they are driving bacteria and/or virii deep into the air sacs of their lungs. Obviously, it's used on children with upper respiratory infection. In the adult applying the Nosefrida service, this infection is instantly transmitted deep within their chest.<br /><br />Given that children and adults are susceptible to different grades of pathogens, this can be very bad. Although as an adult you probably have built-up resistance to upper respiratory agents, you may have never been exposed to them in this novel manner. Users are essentially engineering an unnatural exposure in one of the worst places possible -- deep within their body, and to ultra concentrated pathogens that are usually presented through casual person-to-person contact. Since your child may have an evolved infectious agent that you weren't exposed to as a kid, you can and probably will get whatever they have.<br /><br />The Nosefrida made me very ill twice. Just know that you are strongly exposing yourself to respiratory illness with this device. And, although it does help your child, the cost of having a sick parent may not be worth the benefit of an occasional partially clear nose. There are other devices that do the same thing, too, though maybe not as efficiently.child, the cost of having a sick parent may not be worth the benefit of an occasional partially clear nose.

It isn't awful, and my biggest problem was my fault (figured out several steps later I had the frame in backwards).  However as the directions say tightening the screws into the metal bars requires \\""extra force\\"" and they really mean it.  With my mistake, I was exhausted by the time I got this thing together.  So be careful to check you put the frame in the right direction!!  Ha ha.      I love the teething toy for the baby.  She can play with it and if she drops it is is tethered to the tray and she wont lose it.  The bigger tree toy is a bit too high up for her to play with now and she doesnt really understand that the buttons she can reach cause the music and lights to start playing.  She does enjoy playing with the tree when I hold her up so she can reach it.  Despite all these toys, her favorite thing to do is chew on the straps :-)      I will say I think it would be nice if the tray stayed attached or there was a place on the chair to hold the tray when not in use.  I am a bit messy and I need to make sure there is a clear spot in our small kitchen to put the tray when I am taking her out of the seat.      It has not been a problem for me, but there is no grip to the feet and wheels of this chair.  It is all smooth plastic down there and you can push the chair around even with the brakes set on the wheels.  Also, each of the four wheels has a separate brake that you need to undo before you can wheel it around.

4725,"Before finding the Hutzler 571 banana slicer my life was in shambles.  Day after day I would come to work with my whole banana.  My colleagues would snicker while watching me eat saying things like “oh yeah, you eat that banana” and “bet you can’t fit that whole banana in your mouth.” Being the competitor that I am, I always did, proving them wrong. After shoving an entire banana in my mouth for the fifth time that week I knew something had to change. I would’ve gladly sliced the banana but never had the time or steady hands, and due to my aichmophobia (fear of sharp pointy objects) I was unable to use a knife to cut the banana. The one time I tried to cut my banana was disastrous. I woke up five hours earlier than usual in order to prepare for the task at hand. Placing the banana on the counter I began thinking of ways to slice it. I decided to go with a spoon…BIG MISTAKE! After hours of meticulously slicing away, I was finally finished. The result was horrific. Each slice was curved and a different size than the other. Now running late for work I quickly threw my banana chunks in a Tupperware and left. When I arrived at my cubicle I tried eating my banana as discretely as possible. It didn’t work. My co-worker David saw me eating and all hell broke loose. “Hey guys come have a look at this!” Everyone rushed over and instantly broke out into laughter upon the sight of my hideous banana chunks. One person shouted “who cut that banana a four year old?!” while another said “bet you can’t fit all those chunks in your mouth.” I quickly shoved the remaining pieces in my mouth and ran for the bathroom. While contemplating if I would ever eat a banana again, I started looking up funny amazon reviews to help cheer me up. While reading, I stumbled across the Hutzler 571 banana slicer. While others mocked it not noticing its significance, I realized my banana eating days were not over. Quickly ordering the two-pack I waited for it to arrive, knowing the humiliation would soon be over. When it finally arrived I quickly grabbed a banana, peeled it, and used my Hutzler 571 banana slicer. The results were astonishing. Each slice came out perfectly. I couldn’t have been more pleased, and was more than excited to show off my amazingly symmetrical banana slices at the office. The next day was the beginning of a whole new work environment. I proudly opened my Tupperware revealing the greatness I had created. While eating I heard a gasp and someone say “that is the most beautifully sliced banana I’ve ever seen.” My confidence was restored. Because of the Hutzler 571. I can proudly eat my bananas wherever I please without the fear of being made fun of. This has made me more confident and because of that I am now looking at a promotion. So while you sit back and make fun of this product, just know the Hutzler 571 banana slicer saved my life.",X_train

4734,"Pros:<br />-really adorable<br />-several toys to play with and you can change the position all the time<br />-comes with a little pillow<br />-bars are detachable for exclusive tummy time play<br />-extra loops for more toys or switching the position of toys<br />-machine washable<br /><br />Cons:<br />-price<br />-toys don't hang low enough in the center areas<br />-a couple of the toys aren't really interesting<br /><br />We loved this activity mat for our son. We purchased it when he was about 1 month old. We started using it with him to get some tummy time without the bars installed, and then transitioned to having some time on his back to reach up and grab the toys. We never really used the pillow all that much. His favorites were the owl that jingles, the bird with the rattle balls, and the bird with a wooden ring. The apple and the squirrel don't really do anything; they're just cute. We actually bought a second owl to use in the stroller and car because he loved it so much. You can buy it separately. My only complaint about this gym is that the toys were too high up for our son to reach. He wanted to be able to grab them and pull them to him as well so we put his favorites on ID badge clips so that he could pull them closer (we were always with him when he was playing with it). It would be nice if the cloth strips were elastic or if they included some links to make some toys hang lower. It is nice that there are loops to hook toys all the way down the bars. The mat has some textured leaves, a little mirror, and a squeaker.",X_train

It is very functional, and very spacious. After occupying the side pockets for the pump and bottles, there is plenty of room in the main bag section. She doesn't need an additional purse when going to work. However, when we travel with the baby, it isn't enough to also act as a diaper bag as well.",X_train

4740,"It's the perfect size for our changing table. We went with the Carter's dot cover and it fits great. I personally don't mind that the material doesn't hug the changing pad super tight...I can live with that. I also like that it's four-sided. It's not super deep, but I don't think that'll be an issue. My only worry is the prop 65 (I think that's right...not looking at it right now) warning that comes with it due to materials it is made from. Our little girl won't be on it enough, I think, for it to cause any problem...and we will always have a cover on it (I'm even contemplating using cheap hand towels on top of the cover to keep it from having to be washed as much), but no Mama wants to see a cancer warning on a product they buy for their baby. I've been told not to worry so much about it, especially with the cover and since we are NOT using this as a sleeper for our baby. When we got it, we sat it outside for a full day to let it air out, just to be safe. I think it's going to work out well for us.",X_train

4747,"First of all, let me say that after ordering this last night I was stunned to get the cups before lunch today. Twelve hour turnaround from Amazon - unbelievable.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd been eyeing these for a while for use at my office, because we have a poland spring machine with an instant hot tap. A coworker had also bought all of us coffee gift baskets for the holidays, and I have a Keurig machine at home so not much use for those there. I'd brought in an old French press of mine, but the drip grind is really too fine and I got tired of all the grounds in my coffee, so last night I ordered the Melitta.<br /><br />I was going to get the single cone thing, but went for the cups package just because it seems like a good deal. I'm really glad I did, too, because my Starbucks mug popped a seal this morning and is leaking, so now I have a new travel mug.<br /><br />For the cost of a half dozen cups of Starbucks now I can just use all the coffee that we already have, and it seems to brew pretty well. For those of you who like stronger coffee, like I do, it's not exactly rocket science pouring the coffee back through the filter into a second cup, since it does drip through pretty fast. Great little device.<br /><br />Obviously this isn't going to make the best coffee in the world, but if you're in an office/shop that has ready access to either a microwave or instant hot water, it's definitely an affordable option. It doesn't take up any counter space, and takes less time away from work than dealing with a whole coffee pot.",X_train

You're so busy trying to keep them from sliding to one side or getting water in their ears.  You have to keep one hand on the baby at all times so trying to wash with only one hand is very difficult.  Then I saw this bather on Amazon.com and I read the reviews.  I decided to try it and I'm so glad I did.  My son is 3 months old now and we use this bather for every bath.  Mostly, I just set it inside of the baby bath tub.  He fits right down inside and there is no more sliding around.  I am free to use two hands to wash him and he stays warm during the bath so no more screaming.  Other times I lay it in our bath tub and he just lays there staring up at me.  I have already told all my pregnant friends about this safer bather.  I just love it because it helps make his bath time a good bonding time...not something we're both dreading.",X_train

This holds up to 55 lbs. and the back can be made taller, which is just what we needed.  My son was comfortable and liked being able to pull the cover down to keep the sun out of his eyes.  It's easy to maneuver (if you find it difficult, check the front brakes...my son kept kicking them on).  The handles are tall, as well, which is great for my husband who is 6'3&#34;.

Another co-worker and myself enjoy our coffee everyday and talking about the brewing smells that come with it. I was able to snag this for 3 bucks a brick. This is some smooth and great tasting coffee. The taste going down your throat is amazing and when we open a new vacuum sealed bag we both take a big whiff of that great ground coffee smell. It makes a pretty strong cup of joe(caffeine too) and not for that bad of a price.

4777,"It is an OK seat, but here are some things you have to know before buying it:<br />1. It is NOT made of 100% cotton. There is no cotton at all, it's all polyester. Very soft and nice, but not cotton. I think Amazon should correct the mistake in the description. All other seats I found were also made of polyester, looks like there is no way to get anything natural.<br />2. The canopy is NOT detachable.  This makes it quite challenging for washer/dryer. I have a pretty big washer, so the seat cover fits even with the canopy (and the canopy is flexible, so it washes OK). But I didn't even try to put the whole thing into the dryer. It's very inconvenient for an infant seat, since accidents happen all the time. Also, the whole process of taking the cover off the seat and putting it bask is kind of challenging.<br />3. The vibration turns off automatically after about 20 min (or may be 30 min). Probably, music does the same, but we never use it. Sometimes when the vibration turns off it makes the sleeping baby wake up.<br /><br />I didn't return it, because my baby likes it and I decided not to risk. It is light-weight and good-looking. But non-detachable canopy and polyester instead of cotton were a big surprise.",X_train

4785,"I thought this seemed pretty cool, but I could never get it to work. It didn't come with instructions, but it seems pretty self-explanatory: one end in the baby's nose, one end in mama's mouth, a little foam &#34;filter&#34; in the mouthpiece, and suck the snot into the plastic syringe-like tube. Nope. My son (then 10mos) was fascinated by the process and miraculously lay perfectly still every time I tried it (likely wondering what in the h*ll I was trying to do) but…. really nothing much came out even when he was terribly snotted up. At best I could get the snot close enough to his nostrils to then squeeze out with a tissue. But I could also taste the snot-- the filter keeps actual boogs out of the mouthpiece, but it doesn't keep out the general… aroma… of the mucus. I'm not squeamish, but it was a bit gross. Plus how are you supposed to clean the little foam filter? Or if you're supposed to cut another one from the included extra (tiny) square of foam, how do you cut it into another perfect cylinder to fit into the mouthpiece? Not worth the effort. Went back to the tissue and taught my son to blow.",X_train
4786,"I wouldn't recommend this travel system to anyone. I would probably steer them towards a Graco Snugride or a Britax system. The seat portion of the stroller came broken (which could happen with any travel system). They did ship a new piece no questions asked. The wheels seem a little wobbly. It doesn't feel sturdy. But my real beef is with the infant carrier - oh how I loathe the carrier. The way it fastens is so frustrating, especially when a baby is screaming and you're trying to hurry. My suggestion to any person looking to purchase a travel system, stroller, infant carrier, etc. is to go to the store and play around with it. To buckle the baby in this infant carrier you have to place the two pieces over one another then click them in. If your baby starts squirming or screaming, it's just obnoxious. Sure - not a huge deal, but if you're putting your baby in the carrier every day it gets annoying really quickly. For just a little bit more you could get a Britax system which gets better reviews, or go with a trusty Chicco or Graco. Any friends who have purchased those have had great things to say.",X_train

The wipes container is awesome, it doesn't dry wipes out! Well, in the end I am not going to keep this bag.  I will pass it on to someone else because I can't stand the shoulder straps, they keep sliding off my shoulders and I don't want to be holding it all the time.

I couldn't believe that he would enjoy this toy so much. He loves jumping on it to the point that he put his \\""sad lip\\"" when we take him out.<br /><br />We first used it when my son was 4 months old, since he could hold head steady when upright. My son is very large baby (21 pounds at 4 months check up and 70 cm) and one of the first things I was worried about was if the seat would be too small for him, or he would grow it up very soon. But it is pretty wide and still fits in it without a problem.<br /><br />The jumperoo has 2 buttons, one for sound or music, and another one for off-and music volume (2 different settings). My son is annoyed by the music one, but he loves the sounds. He also likes very much the lights of the two flowers on the sides.<br />He doesn't play very much with the toys, they are average, and one of them, the mirror, I have never seen him using it. He loves the 2 toys hanging and try to reach them all the time.<br /><br />The fabric on the seat is removable (easy enough) and it can be washed.<br /><br />We are happy that we got this one over the baby Einstein one.

When I think it's too sweet or mushy, I pour in a handful of raw, steel-cut oats with the Apples and Cinnamon before pouring the hot water.<br /><br />BUYING ON AMAZON<br />I use the brick and mortar stores to sample products. The items I love and use the most are often at the same price or lower on Amazon (especially once you figure in the costs to drive to the store). These items are often available in bulk online when the local stores run out of my favorites quickly.<br /><br />Quaker Instant Oatmeal, Apples and Cinnamon is one of those bulk items I prefer buying here.",X_train

It was pretty easy to assemble and didn't require any tools. The insert is really simple to remove and its packing function is really handy for transport. We decided to reverse the insert so the baby changing station didn't cover the storage compartment below.

4832,"I really like this flavoring. I try to stay away from sugar and artificial sweeteners so this was perfect because it contains absolutely no sweetener so I can add my own (mostly liquid stevia).  I also love vanilla flavoring in many things I make so I sometimes use this in place of extract which can be pricey if you use it a lot. For example, I make my own almond milk so I like to add vanilla to sweeten and lighten the taste. This works better than an extract because there is no alcohol taste. I also make blueberry syrup with agave and this flavoring and it turns out very good. I put it in pancake batter and the flavor still holds after cooking (also with cookies). I use this all the time and now I am not dropping $10 every couple of weeks for vanilla extract.",X_train

In Honey Smacks, they made Sugar the main ingredient by weight (over 50%). It is now a sugar cereal, with a few other ingredients added to make it look like a cereal instead of a box of sugar cubes. Kellogg’s should go back to calling this cereal Sugar Smacks, as the honey is only a minor ingredient. This product is a sugar and honey coated puffed wheat cereal. As such, it will contribute to dental problems and high blood sugar Type 2 Diabetes. This is nothing for Kellogg’s to be proud of. As a pre-diabetic, I found that after a bowl of this good tasting cereal my blood sugar spiked. I had to drink a glass of water to smooth out the spike, and take a nap until the spike passed.

The arm & hammer freshener is also a nice tough which I'm sure will come in hand once she really begins to use the potty.

Britax of course has a great reputation for safety, and this seat by far had the highest weight limit while still using the 5-pt harness, which was very important to me. Installing and adjusting the seat was fairly easy; the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the seat-belt path directions (Britax says to use the seat belt rather than the LATCH for kids 40lbs or more). There are two paths to choose from, depending on where the buckle sits when you place the carseat into the seat. Per instructions, my belt would need to take the &#34;long path&#34; however when I tried that, the belt was stretched out too far for it to lock (no 'slack' at all) so we had to re-do it with the &#34;short path&#34; which worked perfectly fine.

It has a nice big display, and the night vision is well done. The battery life is also pretty good. I thought we'd use the scroll function a lot more, but so far we've rarely used it, which is why I wish I'd bought something cheaper that had fewer features.<br /><br />On the negative side, the range on this thing isn't what I'd expect for over $200. We tried to take it on our front porch once and had to go back inside because it kept cutting out. Our house is pretty sturdy brick, but it's also tiny so it's stupid that we couldn't use it on our porch. Also, the reception is very easily disrupted/glitched by things like using your wireless Internet or running the microwave. It doesn't disrupt the connection permanently, it just kind of causes it to disconnect for a second which is just kind of annoying and a little lame for such an expensive device. Another annoyance is that the stand in the back holds it at a great angle for sitting on the couch, but a horrible angle for putting on a bedside table while you sleep. This is pretty easily solved, however, by putting something a few cm high underneath the stand.<br /><br />Overall this has been fine for us and I'm not unhappy with my purchase, but I just think that I could've gotten everything I need and use for at least $50 less.",X_train

4885,"We loved the bassinet for my little one when we first brought her home, but a few weeks later the bassinet started to dip inwards because of her weight ( I honestly was expecting it to stay firm longer). I used the bassinet and changing station for the first month and transitioned my baby easily into the playard from the second month. Though when you take away the bassinet, it makes it super awkward leaving the changing station hooked up, so we had to take that down so the baby could sleep comfortably. Wish the design would incorporate a better way to use the changing station once the bassinet is removed.",X_train
4886,"Our first child would take his bottles room temperature, so we weren't really sure what to do when our newest addition only ate warmed bottles. The bottle warmer we had was kind of a pain, so we ordered this and loved it! It heats really quickly, and it's great to have the water available any time. If we needed a little more formula, we could pour just the amount we needed without going through the hassle of heating just an ounce or two to mix with our powder. Highly recommend!",X_train

4889,"My son loves this potty seat.  We bought it for him when he first expressed interest in potty training although he only sat on it fully clothed.  He loves to dance to the music.  It's now about a year down the road and he is actually using it.  I love how it says \\""open\\"" or \\""up\\"" when he lifts the toilet lid to use it b/c then I know he's using it.  A lot of other reviews complain about the loudness and the annoying sensitity.  There is a switch in back where you can turn all the sound OFF.  Overall I thought this was great product; hopefully we can wean him off of it soon and get him going in the big potty.",X_train

4899,"I bought these for my newborn, since they are supposed to start from 7-8 pounds.  However, since they have snaps, there is no way to adjust the leg size, unlike Thirsties covers or Bumgenius one-size that have velcro.  With velcro you can just pull the velcro tighter, even overlap the flaps to get the legs tighter.  For a tall skinny baby with thin legs, like mine, it leaks everywhere since the legs can't fit.  Also, the inserts are really bulky, just like the regular bumgenius insert, but without a newborn option like what they come with.  These seem great and I so want them to work, but we're going to have to wait until she grows.  For now we're using prefolds with Thirsties Duo wraps since they are smaller and have leg gussets and velcro to get a better fit, [[ASIN:B003AJXY1U Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Meadow, Size One (6-18 lbs)]]and then we're using regular Bum Genius 3.0 one-size diapers [[ASIN:B000OFT7OG bumGenius One-Size Cloth Diaper Blossom]]since they can fit more tightly.    *edit* Even at 11 pounds, the legs on these still don't fit our tall thin baby.  *edit* at 13 pounds, these now seem to fit, though the legs could be a bit tighter, they aren't leaking.  Since we had to change to the regular size inserts in her bumgenius 3.0 diapers, these Flips are now trimmer than those, and so we have grown to prefer them.  We would still like the legs to fit better like Thirsties, but washing just inserts is so easy, we'll definitely be using them from this point on.",X_train

4902,Very simple diaper to let baby move around from birth till toddler stage. I like these One size simplex because it grow as your baby grow and you need not to take the diaper and cloth soaker separate when washing them.<br /><br />These 100% cotton and for diaper rashes we usually bound to change every one hour. Only leaving baby wet with cloth diapers invite the rashes so these are main thing to remember when dealing with cloth diapering.<br /><br />They grow with your baby as they have front snap to make size adjustable and upper front snap to make perfect fit around the baby waist. I use the bio-degradable liner for my baby when we started her solid food because those stool are quite messy and smell bad. Liners are boon to all cloth diaper mother because it make life easy as carry the potty liner in one waste bin which you can keep close or wrap in poly bag when you throw into waste bin.,X_train

4907,So my original review on this was a bit harsh. I did not care for the caramel they used in these. It left a weird after taste. Kind of like they added alcohol to the recipe or something. However I was contacted by head of the company and was explained that the recipe they use is not the normal caramel one would expect. It doesn't say that in the description of these but they are working with amazon to fix that. They do however carry these in the traditional vanilla flavored caramel that I think most people think of when they think caramel. I will try them out. I will also say that this company has the best customer service that I ever experienced on amazon. Or really anywhere. It's service like this that will keep me and other customers coming back because other than the caramel I had no other complaints. It came fresh and decorated nice and the chocolate was tasty.,X_train

I won't eat them, though others in my family will. My local store had a clearance on these--a real deal (3 packets for $1), so I bought them for those that do like them, a rainy-day kind of thing. Well, it 'rained' last night. After I made them, I tried them, just to see how much they needed doctoring and what I had to add to make them nearly palatable. To my shock and amazement--they needed NOTHING! They tasted like my own homemade mashed 'taters. I ate them along with everyone else. Now I'm sorry that I only bought a dollar's worth. We're having them again tonight--by popular choice. Try them. I think you, too, will be pleasantly shocked. And no mashing, either:)",X_train

I hated having to use the syringes most of these pain management products came with, so messy, not the best way to administer.

When swaddling her with a blanket, I'd have to swaddle her so tight that I was afraid that if she needed to shift or lean to one side to clear her throat - she'd struggle. This has awesome velcro and is super soft. It's easy for me to swaddle her so that she can't get out - but leave the swaddle loose enough that she can shift as needed.

It is great cold but it is also a really tasty hot drink when microwaved and a little parmesan or blue cheese is added on top.  With crackers and some fruit or veggies it makes a great light lunch or quick snack.  It is also one of the items in my kitchen cabinet that I grab when making soup as it enriches the flavor nicely.

The Fireworks Orchard blossom is also very good, but also somewhat small.  Therefore, to see a \\""large\\"" popcorn advertised was exciting.       However, the popcorn didn't pop any bigger than cheap store-bought popcorn, but had ten times as many hulls!  The broken hulls are large, hard and curled.  Few kernals didn't have open hulls still attached, and trying to break off the hull destroyed the fluffy part.  There were more hull pieces than popped kernals.   The few white/yellow parts are also sort of rubbery/chewy and have no flavor.       Terribly expensive.  It would be worth it if the popcorn were half-way decent, but it isn't.  If you don't pick out the hulls, your mouth is full of them and they are stuck between your teeth and caught in your throat.  I always pop in a frying pan on the stove top for best results.  This was popped the same way as all the other brands.  I will try it one more time, hoping for different results and will update this if the next batch is better.",X_train

With other nipples she would act like she didn't know how to work it.  It does have some design issues with the bottle itself..milk gets trapped around the rim and with pumped breastmilk, every drop is precious.

4980,In my area all the hospitals give this brand out when you have a baby. They aren't the best looking brand out there but they seem to be very functional at calming a new baby. I was happy to see Amazon offer different colors then the standard hospital issued teal and the price was really good. I wish the part that sticks out of the babies mouth was smaller because when you are trying to take pictures it feels like it's covering the babies entire face!! The product is really great for what it is though. Highly recommend these for a baby girl they are extremely durable and when the baby starts cutting teeth you don't have to worry about them chewing parts of it off!,X_train

4985,"So we just took a vacation and we needed a temporary gate to block off the stairs of our beach house.  I was expecting a flimsy little gate but this thing was the complete opposite.  It took 5 minutes to install.  The rubber pads on the ends were perfect and held very well, even with two rambunctious toddlers pulling on it.  The gate mechanism itself was really nice.  Simply lift and swing to open.  There's a lock mechanism as well so that kids can't accidentally open the gate.  The hold-open feature was also much appreciated for after the kids went to bed.<br /><br />This gate is actually better then the permanent gates that I have around our house...that says something, especially at the price this sells for.",X_train

But there's no way you'll get away with sneaking this product on the unsuspecting.

I love trying to eat healthy but Gluten-free, vegan, all natural chips? Come on, how good could they be? The answer is, DELICIOUS! I have to say, I could walk through the grocery store and pick up a bag of these over your typical Lays or Ruffles. The only negative I can say about these chips is that for me they were a bit too spicy. I had to have these with something to drink. However, I was impressed with how much flavor these had and how they don't TASTE like healthy chips. That's the best kind of healthy choices right?

Add some cinnamon sugar ( whey low sugar substitute mixed with cinnamon) sprinkle it on top and then add unsweetened applesauce and sprinkle more of the cinnamon sugar on top of that... Mix it up and it makes a fantastic breakfast so much better than oatmeal and WAY more filling... lasts a very long time....for all those people who said they sell the same thing at Cost Co are WRONG!! Theirs is organic and is half the price of this but no way does the CostCo stuff taste anywhere as good as this nor does this Cost Co stuff fluff up and cook nearly as well!

Whole Foods sells them for $4.99 and they are frequently on sale. Today I bought a bag for $4.29. In fact, I only buy them on sale as I consider $4.99 too expensive for 2.2 ounces of dried kale (let alone the $5.99 being charged here on Amazon.)<br /><br />Considering how seriously expensive Whole Foods stores are, and how online selling doesn't incur the same overhead expenses as retail stores do, the makers of Kale Krunch are TRULY ripping people off here for 2.2 ounces of dried kale. Great product. Questionable company ethics.",X_train

I ran across these and, even though they are missing the frosting and don't taste exactly like Pop Tarts, they are the next best thing.  So far, I've only had these strawberry ones and they were pretty good, even untoasted.  I would definitely buy them again.<br /><br />They come each individually wrapped, so you aren't opening a package with two and so feel compelled to eat both or have the second one dry out.  This makes it easier to eat only one.<br /><br />I might like to have the option of having some gluten free toaster pastries like this with icing, but its probably better for me (and has less calories) than the iced ones, so I won't complain too much.<br />Can't wait to try other flavors...",X_train

I put the high chair in the lowest position and close the legs only 1 notch so it's still stable to stand and I put it under a desk/organizer in my kitchen instead of a chair, it's a great place for storage and I can't believe how small this high chair can become. I really like that it has a cloth cover because it's so soft and comfortable for my son. My brother has a chair with a plastic type pad and it's gross!

5023,"This is a great blend of rouille spices that is both fresh and in generally good proportion. What I mean by 'generally good' is that is is good as is, but I augment this mix with a little more saffron and cayenne pepper. Otherwise, it is a great convenience to have a ready mixed blend that is fresh and aromatic.<br /><br />About the way I augment this: when I am ready to add the spices to the base of my rouille (more about the base below), I use a quarter of a vial of [[ASIN:B008ZLNC5G Powder Saffron, organic premium Persian powder saffron]] and an additional half teaspoon of cayenne. The powdered saffron is actually not significantly more than the three percent of saffron that is already in this mix. Regarding the cayenne - I find that the extra that I add gives the rouille a little more bite, and especially if I am making rouille the traditional way with bread crumbs instead of egg yolks.<br /><br />I mentioned a 'base' for my rouille. I make it the traditional way with fish stock, olive oil, bread crumbs and spices. I also make it using egg yolks as a base. This, too, is authentic, but I think the bread crumb recipe is the original. Finally, when I am pressed for time and want to set the rouille out as a spread over baguettes I simply mix the spices into store bought mayonnaise. Blasphemy, I know, but sometimes one needs to break rules.  In all cases this mix works perfectly. To my palate the end result is as close to authentic I am likely to achieve.<br /><br />The bottom line is this blend is both fresh and aromatic, and works well even without my changes and augmentations. I always keep some on hand in my spice cabinet.",X_train

I found Grove Square Cappuccino by accident.  I add some whipped cream on the top and what I end up with is a heavenly dessert that has none of the bitter taste of coffee.  I also bought the French Vanilla version and decided I liked it so much that I am on a monthly plan.  For anyone who loves flavored drinks this is perfect.  And my hubby finally came around and uses the Keurig for his coffee.  He does not use this drink since it does not have a coffee taste, thank goodness.<br /><br />I have been watching negatives and positives.  It is all a matter of preference and taste.  I happen to love this coffee because it is sweet and does not taste like coffee.  I simply hate coffee and this is a way to enjoy the Keurig and share some time with my husband who does drink coffee.  As for the additives... welcome to this world of the 21st century!  It satifies my sweet tooth and keeps me from eating cake, cookies, pie and ice cream.  So Grove Square bring it on.",X_train

After disassembling the stroller, TRYING to repack it in the box, and driving all the way back to the store to return it, I have decided that Baby Trend is not the company for me.

5074,"I received my package and I did receive at least 30 different (brand) varieties. However, I was a little disappointed that they were mostly coffee. I had selected this particular product because it advertised coffees, teas, cocoas, apple ciders, iced coffees, iced teas, etc. and I was actually hoping to get a variety of all those samples. My package contained coffees, bold coffees, decaf coffees, flavored coffees, with only five teas and 1 hot chocolate, which was a disappointment for my kids. No apple ciders, no iced coffees and duplicates of at least 5 coffees. On the plus side, they did send me more than just 30 k-cups, but receiving two hazelnuts from two different companies is not what I would call a different flavor, just a different brand, so I don't think I really received the 30 different flavors that was guaranteed. I also wish I had been sent more of the variety of other items, rather than the duplicates of coffee. The samples were good and tasted fresh. Package arrived within a reasonable time and was well priced for what I received. I contacted the company and they did not return my email. Not happy with lack of response....",X_train
5075,"About two weeks ago I got two Nizo Solace bras and I love the support they provide. They are my favorite bras by far for several reasons:<br /><br />(1) The bras are comfortable while being supportive. They do a great job of lifting the breasts and supporting the back all day long. I wear am petite and wear a 34D bra size so a good fit in a bra is a lifesaver. In other nursing bras I have struggled with back aches, but when I started wearing the Nizo bras the back aches stopped.<br /><br />(2) These bras also look awesome under my clothes again because they are way more supportive than your average nursing bra. The support keeps the chest lifted and allows me to wear form fitting clothes without feeling frumpy.<br /><br />(3) The cup insert is fantastic. The insert discreetly hides sensitive nipples or nursing pads so when I am wearing a Nizo bra I feel more confident.",X_train

5079,"I bought this set for cheaper at Wal-Mart,  but I thought I would share my experience so far. First, let me just say, this baby monitor is awesome!  I had a nice one a lng time ago, but it was not chargeable. Having the rechargeable parent unit is amazing. I will save so much on batteries and electric. It wont have to s tay constantly plugged,  even though I find it kind of upsetting that the cord for the cameras is removable making it easy fornmy toddler to pull it out. On the bright side of that, the camera is mountable and has the sliding (over the nail or screws head) detail to keep it from  flying down on your little love. The two way communication feature is impressive, as I did not even read that it had that feature. I was a little disappointed that it looks exactly like the tilt & zoom model (other than the cam having tilt & zoom on the cameras). So, when I saw it at Wal-Mart for cheaper after reading about the tilt & zoom model I thought I was getting one hell of a deal for two cameras with tilt and zoom. I think the colors and design should be a little bit more unique between the two models. I cannot manage to position this camera to see everything I need to see. Having two kids in one room and two in another makes placement a bit of a dilemma.  I will most likely need at least two more cameras to see everything, and they are almost as expensive as this whole set for one.",X_train

5089,"We've been using this for over a year. We purchased it when our daughter was about 6 months old. She was having a difficult time falling asleep. She would suck her thumb, but start crying, then repeat that over and over becoming more and more upset. If we went in her room to calm her or even opened her door, she'd become extremely distraught- wondering why we would \\""appear and disappear\\"". We even tried offering a variety of \\""lovey\\"" items in her crib. Like satin, furry, knit, or flannel blankets. Nothing helped. I was becoming extremely emotional, feeling I was making things worse. We needed a video monitor. We purchased it from a children's store for about $60. We had already had an audio monitor that we purchased, so couldn't spend too much on a video one too. The first time we used it, we knew immediately we would never use the sound. In a small house, 900 sq ft ranch, we can hear everything in every room so using the sound was unnecessary. I wanted to see her, see what was upsetting her. In the first week of using it, we discovered that she was \\""petting\\"" the sleeve of her fleece pajamas while sucking her thumb! Each time she'd get close to falling asleep while \\""petting\\"" her sleeve, her body would relax- she would go from being on her side to her back again. Each time that happened she would start crying. Seeing this, we knew the solution to help our daughter fall asleep. We gave her fleece footie pj's to hold and snuggle with :) she chose her own lovie and started falling asleep with zero fuss. I tell you this story, because if the price wasn't right, we wouldn't have purchased this video monitor. We're grateful Summer offers a basic video monitor that plugs into the wall. People call it old fashion and loud, but I call it a \\""night saver\\"". Our daughter will be turning 2 soon. I still use the monitor every night when I put her to bed. We use it now to teach good bedtime habits, like laying down in her crib vs. standing and jumping. The monitor has held up nicely.We noticed interference when the antenna on the camera was messed with, but it was an easy fix. The sound is it's biggest downfall, a constant static noise. With the sound of, the lights still let you know visually if there is talking/singing/or crying going on. It's fit our needs perfectly!

5090,"Mediocre taste and a bit boring. Great advertising - doesn't Rhino Peri-Peri make you curious? Sounds exotic.<br /><br />Ingredients (from the label): Roasted Tomatoes, Water. onions, cider vinegar, lemon, etc, etc<br /><br />By law: ingredients are listed in descending order. Peri Peri chiles are near the end of the list.<br /><br />This sauce is nothing more than one in thousands of boutique hot sauces trying to gain market share<br /><br />Taste: You are greeted with tomatoes, then onion, and the sauce finishes with mild to medium heat. It does seem to have garlic flavor notes but garlic is not a listed ingredient.<br /><br />The bottle has a wide neck opening and for good reason - you'll need a lot of this sauce for a family sized meal. If you really like this stuff you'll be spending a lot of money to keep it in stock.<br /><br />There is nothing terribly wrong with this sauce nor anything very impressive<br /><br />On the plus side this sauce is not overly hot. I'm not a fan of excessively hot hot sauces. It also does not have a lot of vinegar which is another plus.<br /><br />But in the end it is BORING- -  so many other hot sauces are better or more interesting<br /><br />Try these hot sauces before you consider this one (all of which you'll find in your local supermarket):<br /><br />Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (aka Rooster Sauce)<br />Cholula<br />Tabascos Chipotle<br /><br />Exotiic/Boutique Hot Sauces - start with these (on-line only):<br /><br />CaJohns (a winner of many awards)<br />Marie Sharp's",X_train
5091,"This sauce has the slow burn and spread type of heat from the north Caribbean, but is easily tolerable if you are familiar with the Jamaican sauces. There is a slight bite, but nothing like some of the Mexican or Mesoamerican sauces.<br /><br />Piquant and tang are the two main components of the flavor profile. There is also a sweetness that characterizes sauces from this area of the Caribbean, and even a hint of bitterness from the turmeric. In fact, this has a fairly complete profile that, while not perfectly balanced, is not overly dominated by any single flavor characteristic.<br /><br />While it has enough salt to be useful as the only condiment on a table, the actual sodium content per serving is a relatively low 65mg. It's also a thick, viscous sauce that can be spread or used as a rich dip. In fact, aside from the sodium, the calories are so low that the bottle claims 0 per serving. No cholesterol either.<br /><br />If you try this and decide that the heat is wimpy (some friends have made that very statement, although I do not agree), try their [[ASIN:B0075ANB8Q Hell Fire Hot Pepper Sauce by Tortuga]]. It's definitely hot, but not the same wonderful flavor as this one. That sauce is a tad sour and one dimensional in flavor - but if you are seeking heat that one will not disappoint.<br /><br />One final note: this sauce requires refrigeration after you open it, so it's not one to take on a prolonged camping trip unless you can provide some way to store it at low temperatures.",X_train

5155,"Pros: it sits higher than Boppy and My Brest Friend (I have all 3 pillows).<br />The print is stylish.<br />It has these contours on the pillow, where baby fits.<br /><br />Cons:<br />There's nothing securing the pillow to your body. The Boppy curves around you and you can use the ends to &#34;clamp&#34; it on t least one side of your waist.  The first few days postpartum, still with a very round belly, this Balboa pillow would not stay put close to me. You'd have to be really skinny or wait until a few weeks postpartum to use it. Would be nice if they added a Velcro strap like My Brest Friend. Would be the perfect recombination of body fit and height.<br /><br />All that said, I do use it while on the glider chair. I prop the sides up with blankets to &#34;incline&#34;/angle it a few degrees towards me, and nurse baby this way. I do always have the feeling it's going to slip away down my thighs.<br /><br />Boppy is more adjustable precisely because it isn't as firm or tall, although you will have to also prop it up to nurse baby without straining your back leaning forward. My bottom line: there is no perfect nursing pillow yet (for me, at least), you'll have to experiment and see what fits your needs. Different pillows seem to fit different nursing situations: sitting in bed, on a recliner or glider chair, etc.",X_train

5160,"I have just tried the double chocolate cookie.  It will certainly satisfy a sweet tooth, tastes great and very much feels like a treat.<br /><br />However, people could easily mislead the nutritional information and scoff the whole cookie thinking it is just 210 cals when that is only for half the cookie!  To induldge in the whole cookie (which is what you want to do once you have opened it!) would be over 400 cals!  I cannot justify that in my daily calorie count and I exercise...a lot!  Each to their own of course, if you are extremely active or have it in place of a meal then its justified.<br /><br />To half this cookie, it is actually quite crumbly so its not always a clean cut.<br /><br />I think it needs to be hightlighted that the nutritional information for the cookies and the brownies is for half the contents of the packet!<br /><br />Overall great taste but would be better packaged into a relaistic calorie intake (of half the size!).",X_train

I recently decided to buy the Dr. Brown's because I had heard that the venting system was great.  What I found, however, is that Dr. Brown's glass bottles use a plastic straw made from potentially hazardous materials so we returned those right away. Evenflo glass bottles are easy to clean with no small peices that require special cleaning tools.  They also don't get scratched up like plastic.  They are sturdy (we dropped one and it rolled under the car without breaking.)<br /><br />I do not use the standard nipples because I have always preferred Gerber Nuk but the batch of these I ordered did come with silicone nipples.",X_train
5163,"In her constant search for the next to keep her amused, we bought this exersaucer for our six month old daughter.  At first, she simply enjoyed the sensation of \\""standing\\"" upright.  Now that she has two teeth appearing, she is really enjoying bending the flower and hat mirrors towards her to chew on them.  She is also getting much more stability in her legs as a result of this toy. I anticipate the stacking, spinning and sorting toys will appeal to her in the future.     Some of the early reviews about the legs had me worried - we decided to try it anyhow and we're glad we did.  It is slightly challenging to put the legs together, but not much more than any infant / toddler toy.  All in all, this is definitely worth it.  I highly recommend it if you're looking for an exersaucer for a girl.",X_train

Now when I get her out of the car (still in her car seat) and move her into the house, the white noise of the sheep has seemed to help her keep on sleeping - obviously a very good thing for any new mom.<br /><br />We also love this sheep because:<br />- plush, cute, and soft!<br />- easily attaches to her car seat, stroller, or crib<br />- since baby still sleeps in a basinet next to our bed we've been enjoying the white noise as well<br />- the sound machine is removable for easy cleaning of the sheep, or sheep can become a cuddle toy<br />- volume control is lovely<br />- there are several good sound choices, you can find what works for your baby, for ours it's the stream<br />- the timer means better battery life<br /><br />I have a feeling the sleep sheep is going to be a part of our family for quite a while!

However after much practice he was able to walk normally.<br />**Helpful Tip** if you are going to be walking your cat near cars I would wait on it.

I agree with the other reviewer that it does not have the protein( only 2 gms) and calcium( 8%) to compare with milk or soy milk so it would not be a good idea to drink it all the time in place of soy milk. But it makes for a great travel drink given the restrictions in carrying liquids aboard planes. It mixes easily in cold water and tastes fantastic. Yes, it does taste better than 2% milk.   I figure it is better than nothing for trips to places which don't stock soy milk.",X_train

It is easy to fill, and I had no problems with leaks, even when my frozen juice began to unthaw.<br /><br />Again, reading through some of the reviews I wonder if this product has been revamped and the more negative reviews are part of the first version of the pouch.

I was secretly hoping for a brew over ice variety, as well.  No such luck.  I got mostly coffee and a few teas.  Some of the coffees were sort of doubles, even though not technically.  By that I mean that I would get a french vanilla and a french vanilla decaf.  So, there were at least 5 flavors that I got with a decaf of the same flavor.  My biggest issue with these is the expiration dates.  My K-Cups had expiration dates ranging from 3 months ago to 1/2013.  In fact, my batch had 5 expired K-Cups.  The expiration dates for them were early February, so that's not even close to being good.  I wasn't too happy to find that 10% of my order was expired.  Perhaps this is just a fluke or perhaps I'm the only one who wrote a review that checked the expiration dates on every single K-Cup received.

The color is great and I love the material - it's a surface that you can wipe clean which is a huge bonus.  Even though it's a seat that you have to re-thread the straps, it's super easy to do.

I can press one, then the other without the first one locking again. This is crucial because when I want to put my daughter in it I have her in my arms and only have one hand to work with.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it came with a mobile for some stimulation if she's not sleeping.

5239,"I don't understand why not more people are complaining about this, but the volume on this monitor is really low! I've seen some other reviews that are saying the same thing, but it seems most people aren't bothered by it!? Maybe we did something wrong and should have placed the baby unit differently or done something differently on the parent unit - but I tried all kind of different constellations and locations and it didn't seem to make a difference. We were without a monitor for a while until we got this one and during that time we had to listen out for our baby when we were in the living room at night. That worked ok, but I preferred using a monitor just to make sure we'd hear him even if the tv or dishwasher was on. But when we turned this one on it make NO difference at all! The noise we heard on our own, by listen out for him across the hallway was pretty much as loud as what came out of the baby monitor! I'm sure the reception and other features are great and it seems like a good quality monitor - but all that seems pretty pointless if you still can't hear your baby! I returned it for a Graco monitor that didn't have as many good reviews - but I can hear my baby on it!",X_train

These pumps are extremely simple to use and very effective.  Of course they aren't like the hospital grade pumps like others have noted, but they cost a FRACTION of the price.  To poo poo these pumps is quite shocking unless perhaps you had a malfunctioning unit.  They are simple, cheap, effective, adjustable, and probably a bit noisier than others, but for the price, we don't think there is a better option.  Evenflo has done right with this product.

They taste like the most delicious homemade cheese straws you could ever imagine, only better. They are airy and crispy while at the same time rich and buttery, with just enough spice to give them a kick without being too hot. My mouth is watering just thinking about them! They are a great gift and make a delicious and easy party appetizer- just be sure to have plenty on hand, since your guests will gobble them up as fast as you can put them out!

5261,"I love this thing. Originally I was debating between two different (much more expensive) mini cribs, since our fourth baby was going to be sharing our room. But then money was tighter than we expected and I sent my husband on a Target run to buy this bassinet while I was literally still in the hospital.<br /><br />I like the modern design, it's very similar to another bassinet that costs around 2.5 times as much. It's easy to take down and assemble, and I love that all of the pieces fit neatly in the tote bag, with room to spare for any bedding we want to bring with us. It's much less bulky and heavy than a folded pack n play.<br /><br />I'm not sure if Chicco makes a sheet for this or if other bassinet sheets work, but we've just been tightly tucking an aden and Anais swaddle around the mattress and it works great.<br /><br />I have to address a couple of the negative reviews, the mattress cover absolutely is waterproof. Never had an issue with anything leaking through to the actual padding. Every week or two I take the cover off to wash it because it does show &#34;stains&#34; from my son drooling and spitting up, but the mattress underneath is fine.<br /><br />Also, it's firm because little babies are supposed to sleep on a firm surface for safety reasons, but I wouldn't say that it's hard or uncomfortable. I guess I wouldn't know firsthand but my almost four month old has always slept well in it.<br /><br />I would also like to note that it's roomier than I expected. It's a good compact size for hotel rooms and smaller bedrooms, but I can tell we're not going to have any issue with him outgrowing it any time soon.",X_train

5278,"First let me start by saying that I'm a coffee addict and have tried several different k-cup brands. I was looking for a brand of coffee for use in my Keurig brewer. I figured if I'm going to spend the extra money on single use cups they better be worth it. Well these are totally worth the price and in my opinion the flavor holds true even for a larger cup with a few tricks. I have found that when brewing a large 16 oz. cup the coffee lacks a bit of potency when it comes to the overall flavor. Instead of pressing the cup size I just press the 10 oz. cup on the first brew and then to the same cup & k-cup I run a second brew for 6 ounces of water. In doing so, Millstone hazelnut cream is the perfect cup of coffee that doesn't taste watered down as do some similar brands. This flavor is amazing, and most importantly doesn't taste artificial and overly sweet. I drink mine with only a touch of milk in effort to not diminish it's flavor. Yes, Millstone k-cups are a bit more expensive than other brands but if you want to actually ENJOY your coffee this is your brand. Highly recommended! Just a side note, this is a medium roast coffee, NOT bold (which refers to the amount of coffee in the k-cup) so if you like your coffee on the stronger side just add less milk after brewing. Happy brewing!",X_train
5279,"I bought this monitor less than 2 months ago and was very pleased with it up until a couple of nights ago when i woke up and noticed it was no longer on! The battery doesn't last very long so we have to keep it plugged up while we sleep. We had it plugged up as always and it still managed to die. After recharging it we noticed that there is a short where the charger plugs in at! I found out about the 1 year warranty through the Levana site so I am going to try and get it replaced.<br /><br />Other than that, the camera works better than I imagined, the sound is great and there is no outside static or no problems with picking up cell phone conversations like I've heard about some of the competitors. Another thing is the temperature. The temperature feature only works when the camera is not charging. When the camera is on the charger the temperature reads 80 degrees the whole time. The batteries in the camera didn't last long either so we keep it plugged up as well.<br /><br />One of my favorite features is the alert system. If the camera is not plugged up and dies, the monitor will beep until you turn it off so you know that the camera is no longer on! The voice activation and motion censor works well also.<br /><br />Overall, I would still recommend this product, but we will see what I say once I get the second monitor. Hopefully this wont happen every time.<br /><br />It has now been a while since i recieved my replacement and so far so good! I have since bought an additional camera which works well. The only problem i now have is the auto-switch feature between the cameras shuts off on its own. I'm not sure if that is the plan or a glitch though.

5284,"I purchased the Diono Radian RXT Convertible Car Seat after talking with other mom friends about theirs. Everyone seems to love it. I have an SUV and a much smaller car so initially I actually purchased a different brand for it's space saving ability and really, REALLY hated it (it was a Maxi Cosi Pria) because it was incredibly hard to use. After returning that one and getting the Diono I could immediately see why everyone likes this car seat so much. It was really easy to install (didn't make me sweaty and mad), easy to adjust, and easy to use. Tightening and loosening the harness is a breeze - which sounds really insignificant until you have a bad experience with a different brand. Bonus - my child seems to like it(she's almost 1, so she hasn't told me directly)!<br /><br />As for the smaller car issue, I think that with the wedge this carseat takes up about the same amount of space as our Chicco Keyfit 30, so the smaller car should be able to handle this car seat as well. I haven't tried it out because the Diono is heavy and I haven't had the need to transfer it between cars. I will update my review once we try it out in the smaller vehicle.",X_train

It's true (as stated in another review) that there are only pictures to put it together, but my 12 year old son was able to assemble without the directions, so I'm sure anyone could do it with ease.  I was originally looking to get the baby bjorn highchair, but after reading reviews, and watching video reviews I didn't like that the baby bjorn didn't adjust in height or in seat positions.  As the mother of 4, I know exactly what I want in a high chair.  1.  it has to be functional.  meaning:  it needs to recline, have adjustable heights & straps, use with/without the tray, and easy to move. Phil & Teds does all that. True,  it doesn't have wheels, but that doesn't seem to matter.( If it had wheels my other children would be riding it around the kitchen I'm sure.) I can move the highchair from the kitchen, to the dining room to the living room with ease so baby can be part of the family, no matter where we are. (we have hard floors, no carpet).  2.  It needs to clean easily: I LOVE the removable foam pad, adjustable straps & strap covers, removable tray & tray cover. Our baby is 3 1/2 months old, and fits in this highchair perfectly.  BUT there is room for him to grow, and almost EVERYTHING on this highchair is adjustable, including the foot rest.  Most other high chairs on the market are hard to put little babies in, and work only with babies 5 or 6 months or older-- causing them to eat in a uncomfortable position, slumped over.  I can see our little guy growing with this high chair, and having no problems.  For the money this high chair is perfect.  Smart design, and functional details on this high chair make all the difference!",X_train

So I went with this. It is so easy to put together and take apart. The pieces are a great size so you don't have all these tiny pieces all over the place. It's a great size for an infant to play on. I'm considering purchasing another set to make a play area even bigger. But one may be en",X_train

5309,"A sweet treat with a chili bite that comes as an after taste. You can see little hunks of chili between the large sugar crystals. It is however NOT what I would describe as hot. In fact, the sugar and chili layer is so significant that if I had never tasted guava before, this product would not help me do so. You know it is fruit as it is light yellow and in &#34;fruit sized strips&#34;. I think it would taste the same if you used cantaloupe, apple, or mango slices.<br />So if you want to bite of &#34;sweet&#34;, this product will fill you sugar needs. If you want to see if you like the taste of Guava, try something different.",X_train

It's great to finally have a disposable cover! I don't have to wash high chair covers anymore! We eat out a lot, so this is a big plus for us! The price is reasonable! Only about $2 per cover and 6 come in a pack. Would definitely recommend this product to other parents. It's simple to put on the chair, much more convenient than cloth covers, and does exactly what it is supposed to do - protect my kids from high chair germs! It's a winner",X_train

I have enjoyed it immensely and have no trouble making a great cup of coffee.  Unfortunately the Ekobrew I received was defective and leaked quite a bit because the lid did not seal properly.  I saw another review here on Amazon with the same issue and a comment by the company asking them to email them and they would \\""make it right\\"".  So I did just that and within 10 minutes I had a response!  They apologized and said they would be happy to send me a tested replacement Ekobrew.  I was shocked but very happy to hear this.  It arrived today.  This one works wonderfully and I am thrilled with it.  More importantly I am thrilled with the customer service of this company.  I didn't need to complain or whine or prove something was wrong...they just took me at my word and made it right...even going above and beyond by including a small package of gourmet coffee with my replacement.  2 thumbs up Ekobrew!",X_train

I do have to have things on hand that do not go bad and can be made in a matter of minutes. The brand Amy's is absolutely wonderful. I have tried at least 5 of their soups and 7 of their frozen wraps. This soup has to be my favorite. 200 calories, organic, you can not beat it. I usually add some extra cracked pepper and curry powder to it. Heats up in 3 minutes and i have something good for me and of course vegan.

Check out the first ingredient:<br /><br />High Fructose Corn Syrup, Water, Distilled Vinegar, Tomato Puree [Water, Tomato Paste], Salt, Food Starch-Modified. Contains 2% or less of: Soybean Oil, Sauce Blend (Water, Hydrolyzed Corn and Soy Protein, Salt), Spice, Onion Powder, Dehydrated Garlic, Natural and Artificial Flavor, Caramel Color, Colored with (Yellow 6, Red 40, Titanium Dioxide, Blue 1).<br /><br />Nutritionists recommend that you stay away from high fructose corn syrup. If you google Andrew Weill and Michael Pollan and high fructose corn syrup, they explain why it is not healthy for you or for the environment.  One of the effects is that your body produces massive amounts of insulin to process HFCS which isn't good for you.<br /><br />Found Stubbs BBQ sauce here on Amazon which doesn't use High Fructose Corn Syrup as an ingredient. It is delicious. It would be great if Open Pit would come out with a healthier version of their BBQ sauce which didn't involve high fructose corn syrup as a primary ingredient.

Definitely a great break from the basics.<br />It reheats well (because I eat rice everyday, instead of bread for my starch, I make several servings at a time).<br />I have decided to wash it before cooking, otherwise the color from the darker rices is very rich.

I did end up breaking out all over my face in about a week from eating 6-8 per day.  I used them in conjunction with cod liver oil capsules and vitamin D but i believe these were the culprit of the blemishes since it is a known side effect. I am going to wait until my face heals then scale back my consumption of the nuts to see if I can find a level that works to boost test a little but does not cause me to break out.

5381,"Well, we went through a bit of a roller coaster ride with this thing.  We early on decided we wanted this car seat when our lil girl out grew her infant seat.  We were really excited about everything and went to a store to try one out, sadly it wouldn't fit in our Ford Explorer in a way that allowed anyone to ride in the front seat comfortably.  We had heard about the angle adjuster but just weren't certain.  So after more research we ordered one in daytona.  I really liked the cobalt color, but my wife didn't think it was appropriate for a girl.  She liked the spring color but that was just too flowery for me.  We both liked black striped one but worried about it getting hot.  We also liked plum, but my wife was afraid it would get too hot, so we settled on the daytona.<br /><br />Ordered them both from Amazon, got 1 day shipping with our prime trial for $4 each.  They both arrived by 2:30 the next day.<br /><br />First tried seeing if I could fit it without the AA, but while it could fit, I am 6'3\\"" and it would be uncomfortable for me to sit behind the steering wheel.  My wife could fit and she is 5'4\\"".  But again she wasn't completely comfortable.<br /><br />So inserted AA and it gave me plenty of room in the drivers seat.  The latch system works great as well!  It was very simple to hook up and adjust.  There are a few things I had learned in advance watching the videos that made it easier.<br /><br />Lots of people complain about how you have to adjust the straps in the seat, I really didn't find it any different then our keyfit infant carrier.  Actually I thought the straps are a little less complicated for adjusting. With the carseat out of the car, it literally took me just a couple of minutes to adjust the straps, the buckel a little longer but that was because my wife had to do it sense my hands were too large.<br /><br />I do like how the buckel and straps are easier to put out of the way when putting our LO in and out of the car seat.  She is 9 months old and 30\\"" and 20lbs so the chest clamp is a little huge on her, but she will grow into it.

I am 8 months pregnant and have it packed as my hospital bag. It fits all my nursing clothes, toiletries, makeup, hair stuff, baby blanket and going home outfit for me and the baby. I love how deep the outside pockets are. The bag is honestly huge!

5400,"Everyone likes a different seat for different reasons...we liked this one because it can stay with our son the entire time he's required by law to be in a seat...that saves money in the long run. We have had it (forward facing) for 2 months, and we love it! It's roomy, comfortable, and stylish. It was easy to install (actually easier than his rear-facing one was), the straps have never twisted, and the buckle is simple to do. Just put the two pieces together, hold them in one hand, and snap them into the buckle that you're holding with the other hand. It's a breeze! If you can rub two quarters together with one hand, you can do this buckle. And really, it's designed to keep the child from unbuckling himself during a trip...isn't a few extra seconds snapping a weird buckle together worth a child's life? We buy these car seats for their safety features, not our convenience. The pillow is also a nice feature, and if the baby is too short for it yet, like ours, it just flips behind the back of the seat.

5403,"I bought 6 of these cups for my daughter when she was 15 months old and she still uses them. She is almost 2 1/2 years old. I bought a three pack at a wholesale club for a great price. I used this to transition my daughter from a bottle. This worked great. I didn't want to use the traditional sippy cup because I saw no value in that over a bottle. The dentist said that sippy cups work on the same principle as a bottle and there is really no value in terms of liquids sitting near their teeth and creating cavities. With a straw it by-passes their teeth. I also liked the idea of teaching her how to use a straw so that if we were out of the house (on a trip) we would always have a cup she could use. You can always find a cup with a straw. I liked this cup because when the lid was closed it never leaked, not once. It does as some reviewers mentioned, sometimes have liquid come up from the straw. This happens more often if the cup is very full or if you put in cold milk and the cup is on the full side and sits on a table, as it warms up. This really was not a big issue for us. We don't let our daughter walk around all day with milk or juice. She drinks that most often at the table with meals or while sitting on the couch reading stories. With water this was never an issue. If you are the type to let your child walk around all day with milk and maybe juice and discover the cups hours, even days later than this cup is not for you. Yes, if the cup is not closed it may leak (more like dribble), plus if it is left for days I am sure the inner parts of the straw will get moldy. I mean what wouldn't at that point. I think this cup functions as it should and I certainly never had to worry about spills. When you first get it you MUST squeeze the straw to make it work. I ran the cups and parts separately through the dishwaher. I would also use a small Dr Browns bottle brush for the straws. Yes, it's a hassle to take apart, clean and put back together, so are bottle and any sippy cups. You just have to deal with that. My daughter still uses these but not often, beacause she uses a regular cup. I would recommend and if needed buy again.",X_train

5405,"That this product ever made it past the concept stage is shocking. So you don't want hot spots from the microwave? Heating the milk with vaporized water is stupid and wreckless. I have a degree in biochemistry and let me tell you one of the simplest facts of chemistry: when water is vaporized and becomes steam, the temperature of the steam must be above 212 fahrenheit. This product heats the milk by exposing it to vaporized water above 212+ degrees! It vaporizes the water very well, so let's call it 220 degree vapor. That's the replacement for microwave hotspots? The outer portion of the milk will rapidly heated by the steam, likely destroying some of the immunity and nutrients that the breast milk is supposed to provide. <br /> <br />Furthermore, after reading lots of the comments here, it seems that the heating element is very unstable, and may only last days, weeks or months before routinely under- or over-heating the milk. I would not take the chance of scalding my baby. This product is a lawsuit waiting to happen. <br /> <br />The fact that the user has a step where you have to very precisely measure the water that will be vaporized, or you burn your baby is also a drawback, to say the least. <br /> <br />Currently I am using a good digital thermometer and a small pot. I put hot tap water in the pot, measure the water temp at about 100 to 110 degrees, and put the bottle in that for a few minutes.",X_train

People say drink will only taste good with the real deal from the real coffee company... not true.  This caramel sauce tastes exactly like the coffee company's caramel sauce.  I was initially turned off when I saw &#34;sugar free&#34; on the bottle because I would rather eat real sugar than artificial sweetener but does not taste sugar free or has that off taste that artificial sweeteners impart.  Overall tastes just like the famous coffee shop caramel sauce.  One thing ... if you do buy a nozzle for this you cannot use the regular nozzles that fit on alchohol size bottles the opening on this container is bigger... regular bottles are one inch across this is 1 1/2 inch across just so you don't order the incorrect nozzle.

We didn't have a large budget and everything in my budget was rated low or \\""suitable for back-up\\"".  After reading everything online I could find, and actually looking at the carseats in person at the store, I went with this model.      It installs easilly, is not difficult to adjust the strap height if you read the directions, works well both with the latch system and without, is small enough to fit in my smaller car, and seems to be comfortable for my son.  Oh, and no trouble with straps twisting.  And baby loves the handy little mesh pockets for his toys!    The only down-side is that if he falls asleep, his head slumps sideways, but I don't think that's unique to this model...just a downside of sitting upright.    So coming from someone that can't afford $200 carseats for our vehicles, this one does very well as our full-time carseat, and I may very well buy a second one for my husband's vehicle when finances allow.    My advice is to read the directions.  And if you have any trouble getting it fitted, take advantage of your local police/fire-department services.  I accidently put the seatbelt through the wrong slot and had trouble with the seat tipping over (!!!), but the day that happened, I made one phone call to the police department's expert and she knew exactly what I'd done and how to correct it.  No problems since (and wouldn't have been if I'd read the directions properly in the first place).",X_train

PODS gave them a discrete way of feel self-assured on a shopping trip or at the park, and still let them feel in control of their bodies.

The mat itself is also machine washable which is great - these things get dirty fast. For the &#34;sit and play&#34; stage, this play gym has the added bonus of having ball slides on both sides. Baby/toddler can put the balls in at the bridge (or most likely have an adult do it for them) and watch them slide down the sides. Sounds mundane, but infinitely entertaining to a kid. For the &#34;stand and play&#34; stage, the bridge is sturdy enough for the toddler to hang on to and pull himself/herself up.<br /><br />Heads up: this play gym does require 3 AAA batteries for the sounds and the lights that are not included with the package",X_train

I have loved watching him grow with it, from just watching the lights to kicking with the music to finally grabbing the toys.<br /><br />The large mat and many tags for hanging toys makes this a great mat for tummy time. It washes up easily. You can either wipe messes, usually spit up, away or just throw it in the washer, in a pillow case to avoid snagging the leaf or fasteners for the toys.<br /><br />As I mentioned, my baby has used this everyday since he was just a few weeks old.

Although my cup of soup did not look like the picture of there cup of soup on the package.<br />However it was tasty but I still prefer the Lipton Chicken Noodle with White Meat Soup over this Spring Vegetable Soup.<br /><br />This soup is fairly healthy, its all natural and low in everything that is bad for you. True it's a bit salty, but if you add a little extra water it will be fine.<br /><br />This soup is consistently good unlike Grandma's. Depending on the holiday or occasion Grandma's soup would not be consistent all the time. It all depended on how much she indulged as to how the soup came out.

Also I have had a significant reduction in my back and neck pain. I blend 2 tbsp into my smoothie everyday. Would definitely continue to buy this item. Good luck!",X_train

5544,"By the time this was left on my door step to the time I got to the door and tore it open because my kids were so excited to get into these chocolates and see the prizes (which took about less than 2 minutes), we were disappointed to find out that the chocolate &#34;eggs&#34; were melted and not shaped like eggs at all (see pictures). Some of the chocolate melted onto the inside of the box (see pictures). I could hear the &#34;surprise&#34; shaking inside so I wasn't worried the chocolate melted all over it. (I have never purchased this kind of product before so I didn't know what to expect and was just excited to see how my kids would react.) I told them we had to put the eggs in the refrigerator because the chocolate was so melted that there was no way peeling the wrapper off would be easy. When the chocolate finally hardened enough, peeling the wrapper was still hard to do. The chocolate did melt enough to get inside the plastic egg that is inside the chocolate. The paper inside had some chocolate that I was able to wipe off, but it left a spot on it. The actual surprise was wrapped in plastic so it was protected from the melted chocolate. The surprise itself was disappointing. They were erasers with the characters from &#34;Inside Out&#34; on them. In the picture of the erasers, you can see the green one (Disgust) is peeling off in random spots. I felt like the surprises were misleading because the box made it look like the surprises might be a small toy or figurine from &#34;Inside Out.&#34; Nope. They were little white erasers contained inside plastic eggs found inside melted chocolate mess. I would definitely never buy these again nor would I recommend this product to anyone. Ever. Awful and disappointing. One good thing - the chocolate mess tasted good (but the clean up was not fun).",X_train
5545,"i love this stuff! i initially bought it because it's a raw product that supposed to have healthy benefits (which i don't doubt at all) though i buy it now for the taste! it's incredible on salads! it's *slightly* spicy (really more \\""zesty\\"" - the perfect word for it) and has a bit of a green taste... kind of like that found in arugula.  it goes really well with vinegar based dressings - not so much with creamy ones, though your tastes may say otherwise.  my favorite is spinach with cranberries, pine nuts, a little vinaigrette and this salad booster.  a little goes a LONG way... you really only need about 2 teaspoons of the stuff to enjoy the flavor.<br /><br />if you're a cheese person, blue or a hard grated parmesan would probably be amazing, though if you're not, try the \\""vegan cheesy\\"" flavor salad booster or just add some nutritional yeast to this one, which is basically the same thing and cheaper :)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002863BIW Bragg Nutritional Yeast Seasoning - 4.5 oz - Flake]]",X_train

5551,I loved this item as much once using it as i did selecting it off the amazon shelf.  I love the mobility it offers by folding up small with only a couple clips akin the those you would see under a folding table.  I would recommend this product most for those having a spring baby because the top actually zips closed and the covering is entirely mesh.  allows plenty of air while eliminating any concern of bugs making it ideal for picnicking or just being outside on the porch.  The bassinet pad did bend a little with a fitted sheet but the gerber knit cotton ones stretched enough to solve that.,X_train

I use both the newborn and toddler settings for my 5 1/2 month old. In the newborn setting, I especially like how the seat can be adjusted to two heights--one...one at about 70 degrees and the other at about 20 degrees.

5570,This tea has a nice flavor and is nice to drink in the evening (with most of the herbs being traditional evening  flavors).  But the tea itself is not a sleep aid or sleep supplement.  Its 25 mg of Valerian is several hundred times less Valerian than a standard Valerian extract pill.  They add an extremely small amount of Valerian so they can charge more for a 'medicinal' product - note the warning that you should not operate machinery.  My advice is spend a dollar less and get yourself regular Sleepytime.  It's a great tea.,X_train

We had been talking about his childhood and how he thought having a swing would help calm and soothe our baby. When my husband returned from his deployment, the cradle 'N Swing was at our home and we put it together. We immediately ran into problems with assembling the lower seat tube and the short tube, into the upper seat tube. The M5 x 40 mm bolt would not go into the upper seat tube completely and the bolt is sticking out which is unsafe and may loosen once our baby is in the swing. Also, once plugging the swing in, we tested each of the buttons on the motorized frame.

It absorbs the wetness, but it doesn't leak through so the bassinet stayed dry. We also used these when we transitioned him to his crib for the spitting up. And then we used them on his changing pad because we only had 1 cover for that, and it saved us multiple times from having to do laundry in that moment to wash the 1 cover we had because he peed while changing a diaper.

There is also a blue bar that goes over the top with toys hanging on it, well they hang right in her face. You can not move it to a better spot either. The only option is to take it off. The worst part about the whole thing is there is a toy on it ( a phone) that sits in a holder well I had my daughter in it one day and i turned away for a few seconds and when I looked back, if she would have moved down at all it would have taken her eye out.

I think the flavor is good, but I prefer a darker bolder taste, and I think these are a more milder taste with a medium brew. I also feel that when piercing the top of the k-cup, it seems to take a little more effort for the poke pin to actually pierce through. Other than that I feel these are perfect for my mid afternoon, evening cups of coffee. I love coffee and drink all day, at all hours.

5658,"We bought this potty after looking at a lot of other potties. I really like how the chamber comes out and has a spout for easier pouring into the toilet. I also like the 3 - in - 1 feature where the potty seat can fit onto adult toilets and the potty convert to a stepping stool. My daughter is very comfortable sitting on this potty. The only issues I have with it is:  First, the little odor control disk does not do anything. Literally. It is just a marketing ploy. If you dump out the potty every time your child uses it, rinse it out, and then dry it, then you will not have any stink. Besides, the disk lost its scent after a week. Second, the removable potty seat tends to stick to my daughter's rear and come up with her when she stands, before clanging back down - sometimes not even back onto the potty. I put my foot on the potty seat as she stands to prevent this. Third, the wipes on the side are so irritating we don't even use them. The package is hard to open, you push and push the little release button and it still WON'T open! I have to pry it open while holding down the catch. And then the wipes are hard to pull out and tear frequently. These wipes are the worst I've ever seen as far as durability. They tear even when wiping. So to sum everything in a nutshell:  the potty itself is great, but don't bother with replacing the scent disks or wipes.",X_train

My co-workers liked these bars so much that they asked me where to get them, and one of them even offered to pay me for a bar so she can bring it home to her husband (I rejected her payment, of course). I personally like them a lot, as well. In terms of food bars, my favorite ones are probably KIND brand bars, followed by Pure Organic brand bars, followed by these Caveman brand bars.

Install took less than 10 minutes very easy anchors directly to car and feels very secure! Seat itself is very padded seems like it would be comfy and the fabric is plush and soft. Harness buckles are not hard to unbuckle but they are child proof. Best part is the extra room we gained in the front passenger seat.

There's really no contest between this brand and other brands, so really the only &#34;competition&#34; Sapporo Ichiban has is between its flavors. Chicken and Shrimp are my hands-down favorite flavors, but Original is great too. Beef is good, but I don't eat it very often. I've never really taken to any other flavors just because eating those just makes me think, &#34;I could be eating a chicken or a shrimp one....&#34; My kids love these, so I'm passing on the love for these.

The berries are present, but well cooked so the filling isn't chunky.  I used it as a tart filling and it turned out nicely. The tarts were well received (and liked!) by the recipients.  Some fruit fillings have a \\""gelatiny\\"" texture. Not this one. It's more like a cooked fruit puree.  Would also be great as a filling for thumbprint cookies.

However, the problem with this taffy was the way the machine wrapped each piece. There was taffy that oozed out of the waxed paper and when you unwrapped it small pieces of taffy flakes flew all over.  They are sticky and when you try to brush off they melt and do not come off until the item is washed. We had a bowl of them at a dinner party and proceeded to eat them in the living room after dinner. Well long story short pieces landed on upholstered furniture and several of our guests clothing. I was unable to remove from our love seat without damage, my husband used ice on his sweater to try and remove the taffy and had better luck, it truly ended up being a huge mess and did a lot of damage.

The harness itself is very durable, easy to put on, and the straps are large enough that it doesn't rub uncomfortably against their shoulders or back.  The middle strap has velcro, but is such a thick piece of velcro that I can't see anyone pulling it off easily.      The pocket has a zipper, which is a negative, velcro would have been MUCH better.  Also, the inside cloth lining sort of comes inside out (Elmo is very plush) which can get caught in the zipper.  The pocket is SO small that I can't see putting anything in it (anything you could fit in it would probably be a choking hazard to your child, so why you would put it in there anyway I have no clue.  Maybe a pacifier for those who are still hooked to their pacifiers, or pennies for older toddlers...)    Otherwise it's a GREAT safety harness.

I wanted AIO's for sure, no diaper stuffing for me. And I've tried ones like Flip with someone else's kid and hated them. Anyway...between swaddlebees (which after seeing it I returned it without even trying it), Bummis Tots Bots (which won second place with me), and Bum Genius Freetime, I liked Thirsties the best. They fit great, are soft inside and you don't have to mess with trying to get the liners in the right spot (like with the BG). I also like the Tots Bots, I just take forever to tuck the long liner inside and smooth it out, otherwise that one washes and wears great as well. I don't have issues with the velcro (I am not a fan of snaps), the laundry tabs work just fine. I always line dry my diapers. Turn these Thirsties inside out when you hang them, they'll dry faster. I wash a load at night and they're dry by morning. I also have one MotherEase diaper for nights, so far that works great too, absorbs a lot! I've never put extra liners in any of my diapers yet. I don't have issues with them leaking. My son would leak everyday (messy diapers) with disposables, haven't had issues with any of the cloth ones. Yay! Out of my small stash of 10 diapers, 5 are Thirsties. :)<br /><br />**update, now that my son is almost 8 mos, I still am glad we switched to cloth diapers and I'm loving the Thirsties AIO! I had to use disposables a few days ago because I was saving our cloth diapers for our out of town trip and of course my son had a messy diaper. It leaked horribly (and we buy top of the line Huggies diapers, not the cheap ones) and I realized then that since going cloth, I haven't had issues with leakages all over his clothes, I haven't had to deal with stains. It's been great. That said, the Bum Genius and MotherEase diapers have done just as well as the Thirsties in the leaking dept. However, we have hada few overnight wet leaks, my son thinks he still needs to wake up several times a night to nurse so unless I change him in the middle of the night (which he hates and screams the whole time) there are mornings his PJs are wet. Maybe getting a liner for overnights would be a good idea. He does wake up in the mornings with messy diapers sometimes and those do not leak, just the wetness.",X_train

5725,"Received this as a shower gift and it is a lifesaver.<br />It is true that if you have motion going it uses more energy from the batteries -- duh!<br />The light is bright, that's why they call it a nightlight; if you don't like it, turn it off.<br />The light is blue and VERY calming.<br />The sound can be adjusted to three levels.<br />It straps SECURELY to side or end of crib. (I read another review that said they have a hard time with the straps BUT was changing batteries at 3am in the dark with a screaming kid; try changing batteries sooner, like 6pm)<br />It has wonderful bubbles for baby to see and hear -- just like my fish aquarium = soothing!<br />It goes for 18 minutes and I've only gone back in maybe three times to restart.<br />I've had it 8 months, changed batteries twice (so 3 sets batteries in 8 months)<br />Never leaks and baby DOES kick it a lot, using feet to turn on and off.<br />Absolutely the SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ITEM bought or received, including the crib.",X_train

5729,"My wife and I (mostly my wife) spent weeks searching for the right highchair. After physically taking our daughter to half a dozen stores and propping her up in close to a dozen chairs, we are very satisfied with this model. It rolls from room to room, and doubles as a easy chair where our daughter plays for hours a day. It's good looking, too, and comes with a simple one-color cover, if you don't like the patterned cushion. The only complaint is that it could be a few inches higher so we don't need to lean over so far to feed her. By the way, we started using it when our daughter was just five and a half months old and 16 pounds. She fits in it very securely; doesn't get lost in it like she did in most others. We are not yet using the tray, but expect to within a month or so.",X_train

5745,"My wife wanted this stroller so that we could easily push around our new born and our daughter who just turned 5.  Overall, we really like it, but it could be better.  With the infant seat installed (Chicco Keyfit 30), there isn't much room left for the older one to sit without getting a major crook in her neck.  So, she mostly stands on it instead.  I'm hoping she will have more room once our little one moves from the infant seat to the regular toddler seat.  Also, it's very hard to set the latch to keep the unit folded up or closed with the infant seat attachment on.  It bumps into the handle in the folded position making it hard to close that last inch to have the latch reach the peg.  No one will want to remove the infant attachment each time you close it.  It will close and latch, but it isn't super easy.  Last, the orange strap for the infant seat is a bit of a pain.  With it strapped, you can't really easily get your infant in/out of the infant seat, so you find yourself taking the strap on/off a lot.  It ends up not always getting re-snapped and the plastic ends drag on the ground when pushing the stroller.  The plastic end/snap also isn't one handed friendly to unstrap, since it has a safety button in the middle that has to be pressed in addition to the two side buttons.  This means if you have something in one hand and need to unstrap the belt, it's a bit of a challenge with one hand.  Especially when your infant is the thing in your other hand which is probably more of a safety issue than a little one (more likely the one riding on the back) from unstrapping it.<br /><br />Overall, all of our complaints are with regards to the infant seat attachment.  They could use some improvements in that area.  The rest is great.  Nice shade, rolls very nice and the cup holder device pockets are great.",X_train

We got the extension piece and it turned the play yard into 19sq feet - it is perfect.

It has 76 pages, each one color with some cute graphics such as elephants, monkeys and turtles. It covers some interesting topics from first teeth to cost of living.

On roads where there is an incline or a slant, it is too much effort to use the grip.  May be beacuse I am using the grip, I have been noticing that many roads in my Victoria BC are like that.<br /><br />it also presses against the soft tissue of the arm, which resulted in my wife abandoning the grip.<br />I am happy to trade my back ache for the arm ache :-)<br /><br />In the city, I use it  40-50% pf the time and fortunately it is easy to move it out of the way so that one can go back to using stroller's original handle.<br /><br />overall it is a good product but with limitations one needs to consider before buying.",X_train

Works great to let it drip/air dry into the toilet, and then you can store it on the floor next to the toilet after it dries. We are using this often enough now that it doesn't make sense for us to wait for it to dry, unclasp it, fold it, and store it under our sink after each use.

5782,"Loved the overall look, idea, and features of this chair with 3 exceptions.  First off, while there are only 2 wheels on the front of the chair and none on the back, my 2 year old was able to walk right over to the chair and push it around our dining room floor without a problem.  I'm sure if we had carpet it wouldn't be an issue, my our older pergo flooring didn't present much of a challenge.  We bought this for our newborn, but certainly don't want his sister sliding him around the room.  Secondly, regardless of what other reviewers have said, the t-bar is absolutely closer to the back of the seat than other high chairs.  We even went to Babies R Us and compared this chair to all the other ones in the aisle, and it has a solid 2 inches less space than any of the others.  Lastly, the tray has the LOUDEST snap that I've ever heard.  Maybe that seems like a weak complaint, but it sounds like the thing is breaking when you take it off and it's way too loud to do while there's a newborn (or 2 year old) sitting right in front of it.  In the end, this was returned as soon as I could box it up and get it to UPS.",X_train

5787,"The caramel and cheddar popcorn in this mix are an unusual combination. I thought it might resemble the sweet and slightly salty taste of [[ASIN:B009WN4HQO Crunch N Munch]].

My kids and I tried this out and we found ourselves sort of separating the pieces or just eating one type or another. The kettle pieces have a slightly sweet taste to them, so they mixed in with the caramel pieces.<br /><br />If you're one who really likes snacks with a mix of contrasting flavors, this one might be just perfect for you.

5799,"I'm actually not much of one for pink, but when I gave my older kids a chance to choose the color for their baby sister, this is what we ended up with.  I have to say that I'm completely satisfied.  We had previously owned one of those 'switched to a stepstool, multi-layered potty' things and I HATED it.  So much so that we simply bypassed the 'potty chair' thing and taught the kids to sit backwards on the toilet instead from the time we started toilet training.  This one is so easy.  Two whole pieces.  All solid.  No nooks and crannies to clean.  Why did we get it if we're used to using the regular toilet for potty training?  Well, we are using this with our... yes, we're a little crazy... 5 month old.  (We're all allowed to try at least one weird thing with each child, right?) She can sit on it easily and it is streamlined enough that it can sit under her swing between uses.  (some people might have issues with having a toilet in the living room, I realize, but if you're not one of them.. this is the best option for size and aesthetic.)  I truly think that when my youngest is using the big potty, I would be tempted to keep it in the back of the van for emergency use.  It would work for my three year old as well, though it is obviously a bit closer to the ground than most.

I usually keep a few extra of the individual portion sized snacks and lunch items at my desk and that way not only do I have a back up meal or snack for when I get too busy to take a real lunch break, but sometimes, just as an act of kindness, I'll brighten a coworkers day and take them a snack when I see they have a particularly heavy workload or just want to brighten someone's day.  Also nice when we have a group brown bag or bible study lunch and you need something easy to eat or nibble on.  Another thing I like about having a few extra at work is that if I wind up sitting down with a friend during the lunch hour, I can share without feeling like I don't have my own lunch, and they don't feel guilty about it either.  I love the nice, thicker texture of the naked ones and the parmesan ones.  The cinnamon ones seem a bit thinner and lighter and crispier and perfect if you want a bit of a sweet snack but don't want to go crazy overboard with a heavy sugar-laden guilt trip.  These are also wonderful if you like chips with your sandwich, you can just eat your tuna or chicken salad, for example, right on the chips and forgo the bread.  That way you get the crunchy chip experience and can leave out the extra carbs.sugar-laden guilt trip.

5808,"I really wanted to like this tea. I drink a lot of ice tea in the summer, but hate taking up a lot of shelf space in the refrigerator. I always drink unsweetened tea, fairly strong. I was pleased that this tea came out strong enough that I could add more ice and even some water, but I was disappointed in the flavor. To me it tastes exactly like Nestea instant tea powder. Yuck!    I am thinking about trying some of the \\""sweet tea\\"" options, but if they are just sweet flavors over the same yucky base, I don't think it would be an improvement.   Stick to putting a tea bag in a glass and boiling some water through your Keurig.",X_train

5811,It is perfect. We are using it for an antique doll crib and it fit perfectly. The doll loves it as well. She reports it is very comfortable. My granddaughter also got in the crib with the doll and liked it very much. It came very quickly and arrived in perfect shape.,X_train
5812,My baby loves to lay on this.  It's just enough cushion to keep him comfy.  It's easy to take with us also.  It is a little smaller then I'd like but other then that it's easy to wash and take with us.,X_train

5814,"What a convenience it is using the Senseo coffee pods, no mess, pre-measured, and less than a minute from start to finish--which is a rich, flavorful cup of coffee!!<br />Besides that, it is often difficult to locate a local store that sells Senseo. So when I realize that I'm running low, I simply go on Amazon, search for the best deal, and like magic--it's usually on my doorstep in 2 days!!  Such a deal!!!",X_train
5815,"For security purposes I needed a way to see my front gate without being seen, and I wondered if this unit could handle the job.  It's perfect; now I can see who is out there without having to open the blind.  Everything works as advertised with no interference from my internet wi-fi, cordless phone or satellite TV.  There are two adapters; one looks a bit different but the company says they are interchangeable.  I placed the camera in the window overlooking the gate and it gives an excellent clear, wide-angle picture in daylight.  Since it did not work through the dark reflective coating, I removed a small area of the film for the camera to see through. The low-light infrared function is great and the monitor can increase or decrease the light level.  The sound function is a bonus, and the portability is a great feature in case I need to watch from different rooms.  Still another application for this system is to view TV.  I can't get satellite programs on my bedroom TV, but I can put the camera in front of the TV that does get them, turn up the sound louder, and watch the little monitor in bed.  The quality of course is not great, but it can be done.  I'm sure I'll think of more applications as it is so versatile.  The technology of this digital video monitor is fabulous.  The designers have thought of everything, and last but not least, the affordable price is very much appreciated.  Customer service is excellent; a human answers the phone promptly. The DXR-5 has solved a longstanding problem for me with no unwanted complications.  It should be listed under Home Security as well if you ask me.",X_train
5816,"I have always loved Oreo cookies, splitting them in half and doubling up on the insides (way before Double Stuff Oreo cookies).  Dunking them in milk is also a favorite thing to do.  So when I heard there was a new Oreo product out I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />First of all the packaging is great it is a thin plastic / metallic wrapping that pulls open and than self sticks when you close which keeps the cookies closed.  All though the bag is dark and it is hard to see the cookies inside so I almost threw out the last two.  You don't get as many cookies as a normal Oreo package.  I believe my bag had 27 cookies with a serving being 3 cookies (really 5 is closer to what you will eat at a time).<br /><br />Taste wise they taste like the peanut butter cookies from the Girl Scouts perhaps a tad bit thinner.  The cookies are great but if you gave me a blind taste test and asked if I felt there was any Oreo in the cookie I would say no.  I tried to dunk one in milk and it was not tasty at all so be warned.  Once again a great cookie but it just did not have the Oreo taste to it in any way.",X_train

5822,"**UPDATED**<br /><br />**** We've had this seat for just about a year now. We've also added another daughter since then. Happily, this seat is not overly wide (about 19\\"") so we were able to fit it in the backseat of our sedan with a Combi Shuttle and an original Sunshine Kids Radian. They puzzle together nicely.<br /><br />The seat still looks brand-new. Even with my daughter's messy habits (sunflower seeds and grape juice, anyone?) the fabric has NO stains. Very easy to clean and impressive stain resistance.<br /><br />We did find a cupholder that fits onto the side of the seat. Brica makes them as well as Fisher price. It's even brown so it matches.<br /><br />The only thing I've noticed is that the straps tend to get twisted when my daughter buckles herself in. I haven't noticed any permanent deformation, though.<br /><br />When the seat is installed with the seatbelt, I also noticed the shoulder belt can be felt through the seat fabric. It's right across the lower back, but my daughter hasn't complained about any discomfort so I'm guessing her weight is enough to smash it flat.<br /><br />Still very happy with this seat and will be purchasing a \\""sister\\"" booster and convertible seat for our other two when we get our new, larger vehicle. ******<br /><br />It just arrived this evening, but everything looks great so far.<br /><br />My eighteen-month-old daughter loves it. She started clapping as soon as she saw it leave the box. She looks very comfortable sitting in it and I had to fight to get her out.<br /><br />The FABRIC (Hanna) is very durable, similar in texture to twill. I think it will hold up nicely and feels cool to the touch- very good for our southern summers.<br /><br />It was a breeze to INSTALL. It took my husband literally one minute to get the job done in our Mercury Sable sedan. It was as simple as latch, latch, latch, pull, pull, pull. Solid!<br /><br />I have just two downsides that I can see so far, having not used it for long.<br /><br />Thereis no CUPHOLDER. I didn't realize this until after it was ordered. I might be able to find an aftermarket attachment or one that will hang nearby in the car. Kind of disappointing in such a pricey seat, though.<br /><br />This thing is HEAVY! I mean, \\""holy cow, I think I just pulled something\\"" heavy. Not a huge issue unless you're going to have to carry it up stairs a lot or take it in and out of a taxi all day. The weight is probably due to the steel frame. In this case, \\""heavy\\"" means \\""safe and sturdy,\\"" I think.<br /><br />Overall, a very nice, sporty, and attractive seat. I feel like there is a little race car driver in my back seat. I almost wish we had a reason to replace my older daughter's Britax so that she could have one of these, too. :)",X_train
5823,"At first opening the package you get a strong fish smell. That is the oil seasoning. I was highly suspicious of that odor and how it would affect the taste of the noodles. After i combined all the seasoning and add the hot water and mixed it together it came to a nice aroma and a hearty broth. The seasoning packets contain a soup base, oil seasoning, and a coconut powder packet. The coconut combines really well into the soup and gives it a slight sweet undertone to the soup which really gives it an authentic asian taste. This is really a rich broth and one of my favorites. Do not let the fish smell deter you this is fantastic!",X_train
5824,I LOVE this thing.  We had the swaddleme's but my baby was able to roll side to side in them from the day she left the hospital.  She could always break out of the swaddle blankets and I wasn't good enough at them to not worry about fabric getting to close to her face.  The miracle blanket keeps their arms at their sides so she couldn't roll around in it.  She slept fantastic in it and never broke out of it.  We stopped using it at 3mo when she rolled back to tummy and I was sad to see it go.,X_train
5825,"I bought these at a local market. I've eaten a bunch of them and what I have to say is... Do not expect an immediate tea flavor. A lot of Asian foods are about the lingering after taste. I found that the strongest flavor upon first taste is of course dark chocolate. The next thing I noticed was a strong flavor of butter. And 5 minutes later, I'm still tasting the tea. The texture is not as soft as you would expect. However, any softer, and they wouldn't hold shape or the cream. Overall, I like them, but at $8 for 10, I probably won't be buying them on a regular basis. It's not standard American fare, and when you embark on a new taste, you have to open your mind and palate to new ideas. You also have to understand the way other people enjoy their food. It's a cultural thing. I'm sure there is someone from another country out there who finds tater tot casserole repulsive. The first time.",X_train

5829,"Boy am I glad I didn't listen to the negative feedback written about this chair. I waited for it to become available for about 3 months and it was totally worth the wait. It is the cutest most convenient little chair on the market and matches my dining room set perfectly! I was actually surprised that it matched because the color is called espresso which I thought would be black but its more of a chocolate cherry color...beautiful. This chair is well built and very sturdy. It is a perfect height for feeding so you don't need to reach up to your baby while sitting on your own chair. It is super easy to clean and the for deeper cleaning you just remove the plastic tray and throw the cushion in the washing machine. My baby also loves the convenient footrest. After testing out a few of those white plastic clunker chairs I\\""m even more happy that I purchased this stylish compact chair which takes up almost no room and is great for our small apartment. The tray also doesn't get stained like the white ones do. I have heard other people brag that their high chairs recline but umm.. why would you want your baby to lay back in her highchair? I find it odd. Anyway I really just felt like I had to write a review for this chair to let everyone know how great it is and that this is the highchair for you!

This lives in my son's diaper bag so that anytime we go to a restaurant or to company's house for dinner we will have it. I love the fact that it is a CLEAN place to cut up food for my son, or dump Puffs or Cheerios out for him to grab (I would never be able to do that on a restaurant table - GERMS!!! And if he had a plate he would just knock it off the table.) The best part is the little hanging crumb catcher.

I love the fact that you can buy an additional base for less than $35.00 to add it to\   my husbands car. so no need to purchase a second expensive car seat. A very good investment. Excellent quality and wheels just glide sooo smoothely even oven rough concrete. Also like the fact that car seat removes from carriage no need to buy a second carriage as baby gets older.,X_train
5843,I must say day to day I do not and cannot use this pillow.  I get to sweaty and can't turn over.  The not being able to turn over part is why I purchased this though.  I had shoulder surgery and was trying to sleep in a recliner.  It was not going well.  I tried this pillow and was able to sleep in BED.  It kept me from being able to turn over onto my bad shoulder.  For that reason I love this pillow.  It is now put away in the even of any other events.,X_train
5844,My son slept in this for 4 months and it was a life saver! We loved the vibrating feature at first. When he was really young it helped put him to sleep. I remember reading other negative reviews and I have no complains. I wash the bedding every week or so and had no problems.,X_train

I like that it doesn't NEED them (most gates require screws so this was a real plus) but would probably be stronger with them. Case in point: My toddler was able to shake the door hard enough and it popped off. So I obviously tightened it and it now keeps him out but then the auto-close did not work correctly. I followed all the steps, did their trouble-shooting guide etc but it just didn't work well.

It is small and meant for relatively smooth, flat surfaces such as parking lots and stores. It's not really robust enough for long walks or hikes. The basket is average sized, but not accessible without removing the car seat.<br /><br />It works with any Graco infant seat with either the quick connect or classic connect label, which is great for families who plan to have multiple children.<br /><br />Overall it is a great accessory.

5878,"Bought the gift-set version of this item, which comes with ground coffee.  Tried using that, as per the instructions, and it backed up, overflowing with water and grounds, which not only makes a poor cup of coffee--weak AND coffee grounds present--but makes the machine very messy and must be cleaned.  Tried it with coffee to the fill line, and 3/4 of that, and then with only half of that, didn't matter as the problem still occurred.  As the instructions for this point out, I can't change the pressure on my Keurig, so they need to compensate for that, but haven't.  I would not recommend buying this.  I'm also not sure that there is a good solution for a refillable K-cup product at all; after doing some research it sounds like even Keurig's version is bad, just read the reviews for it.

I was quite surprised though.<br /><br />I had the Quaker Real Medleys Apple Walnut Oatmeal, and although it's not quite my style flavorwise (picky eater) it was pretty good.  The flavor was strong.  The fruit still tasted good.  Also, it was a lot easier than mixing up my own oatmeal concoction in the morning.<br /><br />I could see it being an excellent breakfast for a kid on the go (the container is pretty great) or to take with you to the office when you're in a hurry in the morning.

5894,"Product was not packaged well; the box was caved in and smashed when delivered. Nothing easy or simple about installing or using this gate, especially if you have uneven walls (baseboards) to drywall.  Included is a cut out Guide to mark the wall; but it is not accurate.   It takes 2 people to install the gate because of the way it is put together and how heavy it is. The spaces are wide and the gate does not sit close to the floor after installation leaving too much space if you are using it for pets, had to attach plexiglass to fill the spaces. The gate is not easy to open and Drops down when you swing it open unless you make your own adjustments.   It looks nice after finally getting it even but to open it you have to move a latch then lift the heavy gate from a small notch to swing it.  Not recommended by me.

5915,"A friend  with diabetes  had a growth removed from her leg. Because diabetics have very thin skin, two months had passed and the wound had still not healed.  She was also in pain.   On hearing this, I over-nighted  two bottles of Trivedi Water to her and suggested that every time she changed the bandages--twice a day--she put some Trivedi Water on the wound and let it dry before she put on a fresh bandage.  In TWO DAYS she saw such a difference in her leg she could hardly contain her enthusiasim. She went to the doctor two days later for a scheduled appointment and on seeing the progress, her doctor said that instead of going every week to have the wound checked, she didn't have to go back for another three weeks.    My friend kept using the Trivedi Water and when she did go back to the doctor three weeks later her leg had completely cleared up and the wound completely healed! She cannot stop thanking me for sending the water to her. She is now also drinking it.  Anyone who is familiar with  diabetes knows that it takes quite long for incisions and open wounds to heal, not to mention that it is especially painful.  This water is truly God sent!

I bought it again for my second child and will be using it with her as well. Good purchase and baby never had a problem with its taste and you don't have to clean it off before feeding. Would recommend to all my friends since you don't have to get it all over your hands. Better than the traditional lanolin cream that can be messy and you have to use your hands to apply it.,X_train

The product works well, it safely sterilizes bottles, nipples, and the parts for my breast pump but as far as the bottles are conconcerned if you have long/tall bottles they will not fit inside unless you lay them flat.

5928,"One thing I've noticed about many other brands of booster seats is how light and insubstantial they seem.  Not so with Britax - as with their car seats this booster seat is solid protection.  It's a heavy, solid seat but also well padded and contoured for comfort.  The built-in slide guard helps ensure that your child can't slip underneath the belt and out of the seat which is I think the best feature.  The back is removable for when your child gets to that stage/age where they no longer need such a large booster seat.    We've loved using the Britax car seats and are happy to move up to their booster seat now, both for the safety and comfort it provides.",X_train

(So I dont have to take mine off every time we travel - which we do quite a bit.)  I havent had any problems with reception.  I do wish the parent unit had a recharging base.

I love that this stroller has so many options for one or two seating (for when we have another).  The only negative thing is the locking mechanism.  It does'nt stay locked, which makes it hard when you are getting it in and out of cars.  Its a little on the heavy side, but very easy to pick up and unfold by myself.  Also, if you choose black, beware that in the summer it will get hot.  We have to put something down on the foot rest area for my son because it gets very hot on his legs.",X_train

5934,"I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THIS STROLLER WHEN my baby was born, so I could stroll with my 2 yr old and baby, but I was stubborn and waited until she was 14 months.   I love love love it and I am really judgemental on gear...I love the easy unfold and fold up.  This stroller comes with snack trays, that lift up for easy in and out - a HUGE basket that holds everything, the front inset wheels are supurb!  An excellent redesign!  The cup holder is nice but whatever doesn't hold all cups/bottles - i don't mind,   I really love the separate sun shades for each side they go really low.  The recline is nice for each child as well.  Unfortunately, the con, drawback,  is the seat belt.  Its terrible, the shoulder straps are not bolted down to the back of the seat -they are free and just a little part slides on the back of the seat, but oh well- Peg Perego is passing it off as some 180 mobility thing.  The breaks are great, nice big handle.  BUT you will need a little clip or hook or something to hold that extra bag or purse.  It is much lighter than i had expected.  I was going to buy this from Target and pay more - but took a chance - and bought from Amazon, I saved 100$, shipping and tax - SO nice!! I am so glad i did  as I am very satisfied with this stroller!!  I would recommend it, if you are not for the tatum (long strollers) I did not like those, i bought one -the joovy ergo - and Hated it- it was SOOO LONG like a limo - and Heavy. I could not fold the damn thing - I was not strong enuf- i eventually sold it on craigslist and waited til my mind changed and started liking the side by sides...  Just keep your options open and look/reseach it all -     I did read numerous other reviews on this stroller(60/40)and don't worry about the squeaky wheel - it can be fixed with some WD40---  Go for it and you'll love it too!!

This is the only one that I can honestly say has worked perfectly from baby stage to stage.  Fits perfectly in our kitchen double sink.  I'm not breaking my back at bath time.  Baby is comfortable and happy in it.  The &#34;bump&#34; in the bottom of the tub holds baby up very nicely so I'm not having to worry about him sliding down while bathing.

5945,"My usual morning ritual is a hot cup of instant coffee, with a heaping spoon of creamer, and a single packet of Splenda. I was curious how  my coffee would taste if I substituted Splenda for Pure Via, which I received free from BzzAgent.  So I went for it! My first impression is that Pure Via isn't as sweet as Splenda so my coffee tasted a bit off. But I didn't give up! So on day 2, I tried 2 packets of Pure Via and this time attained the same level of sweetness that I am accustomed to in my coffee. Woo hoo my usual cup of coffee is back in full effect and there is no aftertaste! BUT I am not too sure I like the idea of putting two packets of sweetener in my mug...makes me feel like I am being excessive in terms if effort and how I'd have to buy 2x the packets if I were to replace my Splenda. I do give it Pure Via credit for being 100% natural though and continuing to make me feel guilt-free about my daily cup (or two) of coffee!",X_train

I've made pasta sauces, cream soups, french toast and lots of other things. (I'm sure the flavored varieties would be great with french toast!)

5968,"I'll start off by mentioning I'm a bit of a stroller snob and I love researching products, so my research has been extensive. Also, I've used MANY strollers, so my review takes into consideration all other strollers I've tried. Basically, this stroller is perfect.<br /><br />Here's why:<br />1. The seat is adjustable in so many ways! Baby can face me or face away from me. The seat goes from sitting fully upright to laying flat. The footrest is adjustable to work with each seat position.<br />2. The straps are easy to adjust. Just a few snaps and it adjusts to the right height.<br />3. Ridiculously easy to assemble. For someone who has little patience for readings instruction manuals, this was a key feature.<br />4. Folds with seat forward AND rear facing. No need to turn the seat around to fold it up. Huge plus!<br />5. Has the ability to work with infant carriers. I'm hoping baby #2 tolerates the infant carrier so I can make use of this convenient feature!<br />6. A bassinet attachment is available. That's originally why I purchased this stroller. My baby hated the infant carrier, so I wanted a bassinet stroller. By the time I purchased this, baby was actually big enough to sit in the seat (she was 10 lbs at birth), so I didn't need to purchase the separate bassinet. And since the seat reclines, she was still able to sleep in it. Huzzah!<br />7. Smooth ride. Goodness me, it rides so smooth! I push with one hand with ease. My mom used it when watching baby and she still raves about how easily she could maneuver it.<br />8. Affordable. I wasn't ready to make the plunge to purchase the City Select. Since I don't plan on having my kids close enough to have two in a stroller, the Versa was the best option for me.<br />9. Apparently it's possible to purchase GT wheels for the Versa! I just learned this and I'm so excited. I will definitely purchase them. However, the wheels it comes with are excellent. No need for other wheels unless you'll be doing anything a little more off-road.<br />10. The storage basket underneath is so roomy! I've grocery shopped with this thing and it was awesome.<br />11. The handlebar is adjustable. I'm 5'9&#34;, so I had to have a taller stroller. I'm sure this works for shorter individuals as well, since the handles adjust.<br />12. The fabric is so easy to wipe clean (and machine washable!) and I love the silver color. I purchased the silver because black is too hot for our AZ summers and silver should handle sun fading better than the other colors.<br />13. Comfort. Baby loves this stroller and she's picky. She had to see me for the first 6 months of her life, but now she faces outward. She's tall and has plenty of room to grow into this with its tall height and deep seat.<br />14. The canopy is incredible! It's large and provides extensive coverage. When not in use, it's not in the way as it folds up compactly.<br /><br />The only con to this stroller is the weight. It's heavy. I just purchased the City Mini to travel with and I hope I like that as much as I love the Versa. For every day use, the weight isn't an issue. I get it in and out of the trunk fine and don't have any need to carry it. I put baby in the car before folding it and placing it in the trunk.<br /><br />If you're looking for a Versa-tile (😉) single stroller that's affordable, this is the one for you!",X_train
5969,I love this safer bather. It is soft on baby's back and keeps her in place. I've not had a problem with it starting to smell like mildew. I just wring it out after every bath and hang it up to dry. Now that she's older (7 months) she doesn't sit still any more but I will use it with next baby.,X_train

I love these hash browns, the crappy  thing here is the SELLER not the product. I find it very unprofessional to be sending out almost expired product. I buy the regular flavor at the local grocery store and they are typically expiration dated about 10 to 12 months out.

5980,"I read a lot of good things about the Woombie so decided to give it a try.  We have an escape artist and he's used to the Halo SleepSack Swaddles after being in the NICU for 3 weeks.  After so many reviews and buying multiple kinds of swaddlers (we personally weren't fans of the Halo ones, even if he was), we got a convertible Woombie and the Wrap and Snap.  We found he does not seem to like the W&S one and I found it a bit annoying to be honest.  While he wasn’t able to escape it, the wrap was a bit tighter than he liked and we could only loosen it by so much without it becoming unsafe.  Especially since the wrap went around a couple times – which I wasn’t a fan of.  He did like the Convertible one since we could let his arms out while it was “awake time” and we liked the snugger fit of the fabric over the Summer Infant version.  So yes, we definitely like the Woombie and I’ll probably get a couple more convertible ones. I'd give this a 5 if only the wrap wasn't so long.  Otherwise, a good product.",X_train
5981,"This is some of the best tea I've ever had, and it is well-priced here.  I take a box to the office and keep one at home.  Ginger aids digesting and circulation.  If you find it too sweet, use half a packet.",X_train
5982,"We've used this model for five months, and consider it a quality product. It's great for daily use, and our child plays in it regularly. Overall, I feel like the construction is good, however it is important to read the instructions when assembling it. It is easy to assemble as long as you have a good understanding of the order in which it must be assembled.<br /><br />We ran into problems with ours and had to replace it after a relative tried to assemble it after we collapsed it in order to travel. Since he was unfamiliar with the re-assembly instructions, he placed a lot of strain on the plastic in the corner and split it, leaving it dangerously weak. We replaced it with the same model because we were pleased with the first.<br /><br />When used properly, the play yard has never even hinted at such a problem. It collapses quickly, and re-assembles quickly. It is great for travel.<br /><br />It would be five stars if the bassinet was more firm. I never felt completely comfortable allowing our child to sleep in it at night when we traveled. Otherwise, I highly recommend it.",X_train
5983,"Love the Dudes Fry Sauce!  If you have not tried it, you have no idea what I am talking about!<br />A friend from Utah turned me on to this 10 years ago, but I had forgotten about it until a recent visit to a local bar.

5987,"I purchased this item recently to use with my 2 kids (1 and 3). We have a BOB stroller (our stroller of choice), but needed a smaller option to take into the city on vacation. I had heard from friends that older kids love Buggy Boards, so I decided to give this one a try. It is definitely a hit. My three year old daughter loves it. Installation took a little time, but was nothing I couldn't handle. You have to adjust your stride just a bit while walking with it, but it's really no big deal at all. My only disappointment was that when flipping it up, it really doesn't flip up flat against the stroller. However, this really hasn't been a problem, because it comes on and off so easily. I would definitely recommend this product. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I do think it's a bit pricey for what it is.",X_train
5988,"Great Lapsang Souchong just like I remember it.  Quick delivery, good packaging.  We used to call it 'stinky' tea in my family (decades ago)  It has the woody/fire smell, definitive aroma, not for everyone, but I love it.",X_train

5992,I loved working with this fondant. It was easy to apply and spread and I live in a temperate country. Also in terms of taste it is on the better side of most store bought. DO not expect it to taste like homemade marshmellow fondant but it does not taste artificial. The white is also a nice bright white that takes colour well and can be spread pretty thinly without tearing,X_train

I am sooooooo happy to have found these and will for sure be a return customer. The size of the rings are very slightly larger than what I was used to buying, but they are not too much noticeably bigger so that will not be an issue but just wanted to let you know. They seem to be fresh enough and have a nice green color to them. I like to add a lot of them to sour cream along with some salt & pepper all mixed up and allowed to sit a few hours in fridge to serve along with my baked potatoes. Everyone seems to love them that way.....but it takes a lot of chives to achieve the taste so now with this large size container I can add without freaking out about the cost.",X_train

I bought the 12-month size so that my 5-month-old would have room to grow in it, but they fit him perfectly. (I'll admit that he's a little big for his age, but according to the growth charts he's only the size of a 7-month-old, which still seems a bit young to be filling out a garment for 12-month-olds.)<br /><br />Order a size or two larger than you think you should need, and you'll probably be perfectly happy with this onesie.",X_train
6003,"This milk is such a great value to have on hand, less expensive than milk from store and lasts so much longer.  I haven't used it for baking yet.

I feel that the flavor is too strong otherwise.  I feel a slight energy boost that lasts a few hours, but it does not give me the jitters like other energy drink have done in the past.  I drink it mostly because I no longer drink soda, but I want something other than straight water to drink with my lunch and need an occasional boost.  I haven't grown tired of the three flavors yet, although I prefer the orange and grape tubes over the fruit punch. It is nice that the tubes are easy to cary around and do not take up lots of room. The packaging I think could be done a little better as to not use up so much room in my cabinets and to be a little more economically friendly.",X_train

6020,"I got this swaddle/sleep sack for my 3.5 month old, as she was getting too long to be swaddled in the Miracle Blanket. I chose this product because it would be large enough to swaddle her for a few more weeks, and then can be used to swaddle arms-free, and eventually just as a sleep sack. My first disappointment was when I opened the package and saw that the swaddling wings are permanently attached to the sleep sack. The product description on Amazon.com says: \\""The unique 2-in-1 design allows the swaddle feature to be removed when baby outgrows the need for swaddling and the wearable blanket can be used alone\\"" -- that is not the case. I decided to try it, anyway, for swaddling, but it isn't very good at swaddling -- my daughter can get her arms out the bottom and push the swaddling part up towards her face, which seems unsafe and certainly doesn't help her sleep. I regret not having read the other reviews before buying this and hope Amazon will correct the product description to show that this cannot be used as a sleepsack without the swaddle.",X_train

6026,"The model I have is actually the Chicco Keyfit30 Magic (referred to from here on out as \\""Magic\\"") which is in essence the same as the original Keyfit30 car seats (referred to from here on out as \\""Original\\"")but with a few improvements.  But even with the improvements, I rated the Magic 4 stars because there was one issue that wasn't addressed and could be an issue depending on your child.<br /><br />But I compared the two models side by side at the local Babies R Us and decided on the Magic model and here is why:<br /><br />1. The Canopy on the Magic is larger than on the Original(even when the extra sun visor on the Original is extended) plus it has an extendable mesh section on it as well.<br /><br />2. I've read other reviews where they had problems with the canopy on the Original not staying in place and this was fixed on the Magic model as well.<br /><br />3. There was also another review here that said there was piping on the car seat cover that left a dent in their son's head and that issue was addressed on the Magic as well - they removed it altogether.<br /><br />4. The material felt breathable (but only time will tell as my son is not here yet)and much more plush/cushiony overall.  Even the infant inserts felt thicker, which may or may not be a good thing (again, my son is not here yet).<br /><br />The only con that Chicco did not address in this new model is that the crotch strap/latch is not adjustable so it only has the one position/length. (Or if it is adjustable, I haven't figured it out yet.)I know that some reviewers had issue with this but I guess that would vary from child to child.<br /><br />So far the only place that I have found this new model is at Babies R' Us and it's only available in one color scheme which wouldn't have been my first choice (I really liked the Midori colors) but I opted for the improvements over 1st choice in color.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope this helps those who are still searching for a car seat.<br /><br />*****UPDATE 3/29/13******<br /><br />I'm really happy with this infant car seat and am glad I bought it!<br /><br />The canopy with the extension was the perfect size and I liked the mesh extension - it came in handy down here in Houston. No real issues with my son getting too hot and sweaty (I really don't think there is any car seat that can keep your child completely sweat free during the Houston summers).  The cover is easy to remove and wash and no problems with the crotch strap being too short and my son was in the upper 90th percentiles for weight and height.",X_train

6055,"I've drunk whole-bean Tanzanian peaberry for about 20 years.  My first source was the large national retailer and wholesaler Green Mountain, which roasted their Tanzanian peaberry light to medium.  Although the beans made good coffee, Green Mountain's price eventually became higher than I thought reasonable.  An internet seach led me to a small family-owned and family-operated roaster in Tennessee.  Their beans were also light to medium and, thus, had a dry appearance.  That level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine, and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts.  When the Tennessee roaster's computer system crashed and online sales were temporarily suspended, I did another internet search and found Amazon's Tanzanian peaberry roasted by Coffee Bean Direct.  It has essentially the same good taste as the Tanzanian peaberry from the Tennessee roaster, and the price is lower.  I'm totally satisfied with the beans roasted by Coffee Bean Direct, and the shipping by Amazon is quick enough that buying three pounds at a time allows me to place my next order before the current one runs out.",X_train

We ordered this is size small and so far it has worked out great for sizing. Our girl is currently 6 months old and on the smaller side (15 lbs). She has been using it for about a month now and  she still has a bit of room to grow into.<br /><br />She has no trouble rolling around in the crib (once she learned how to). I was worried that having her legs \\""stuck\\"" in a sleeping bag would prohibit her from positioning herself but she is definitely able to get as comfy as she sees fit :)<br /><br />Best of all your babies will look unbelievably adorable in these little sacks.<br /><br />I wish everyone some sleep-filled nights!!!",X_train

The sound activation is great as well.<br />The only problem we had the first night we got it our little two month old wouldn't sleep because she just starred at the projection. She thought it was the coolest thing her little eyes had ever seen. It really is great. Now that she is over the fascination of animals being on her ceiling she goes right to sleep.

I feel a lot better about giving this to my kids when they can have candy, than giving them the lab-created 'main brands.'  Read the label on a bag of 'WW's' and then read the bag on this.  Much better!<br /><br />Sadly, I contacted the Unreal company on two occasions asking for help getting Unreal Candy into my town, and they were pretty lackadaisical about the whole thing.  I guess they don't care if we have it here or not.  :(<br /><br />It's too expensive with shipping to order it online, so I'll have to wait until my little town carries it.

I don't use the ice pack to take the bottles to daycare as they go from my fridge to the daycare fridge and my commute one way is only 30 minutes.  I do use the ice pack for the one that I take to work and it is a tight fit using caps instead of tops.  Even with the tops, I can still fit 4 bottles and the icepack, just seems like the cooler is bursting at the seams.

It's unbelievable.  Number 1 on my list of favorite face moisturizers!  Only the &#34;Perfecting Time&#34; version contains argireline, so don't think that just because it's Devita and it's a face lotion that it is the same.

6108,"This is a great product. The reason why I choose this stroller was because my sister has purchased the same stroller but the double version and I used it and loved it. I couldn't believe how well it turned, specially, at the mall and in and out of stores. For use a large stroller (the double one) it maneuvered extremely well! Also, I owned three other strollers prior to this one and one being a Perego Pliko P3 stroller that is supposed to be an outstanding stroller (however the price is outrageous compared to this stroller), and of all the strollers I have owned and used, I disliked them all this is by far the best product! I have not had any problems with this stroller. I have recommended it to many people and many people have actually stopped me on the road to asked me what kind of stroller it was and where they can get it. It is so easy to maneuver and great looking. The only issue would be that it is a bit heavier than any of the other strollers I used but it's not that bad considering all the other great aspects about it. I love that it has a cup holder that detaches. It has a seat that reclines and also can be removed to face out or mommy. I LOVE THAT! Plus, it comes with a universal attachment for if your baby is an infant and you want to just take the babies car seat out of the car and click in right onto the stroller, it works. That is the best... the only thing I was disappointed with and didn't realize it until I purchased it and got home was that it wasn't quite compatible with my Britax car seat. You can still use it with Britax (although, the manufacturer doesn't recommend it) but it doesn't CLICK in and you MUST use the straps provided with the stroller to keep the car seat secure. It really wasn't so much an issue for me, as my child is 7 months old and big enough to use the seat provided. (I did use the car seat attachment a few times, but had to keep the straps on tight) I hope that this review is helpful. If you are debating about getting this stroller and something else, I HIGHLY recommend this one. Specially, the one with the one wheeled front. That way, you can use it for walking/running as well.

Not that hard to put together, but wood is flimsier than it looks in the photo.  First the crib rail split in the center of the top rail.  Ordered a new crib rail, $60.  Daughter teething on tops of side rails, now it looks like crud b/c finish is missing.  Then drawer keeps falling off tracks.

The company will not offer any assistance, asked me for photos, and won't replace the piece unless I pay for it!!!  The brackets that hold the board that supports the mattress keep getting recalled.  Oh, and one more wonderful thing: in order to make this crib--> toddler bed--> child's bed, you have to buy more pieces to it!!!!

So my options were to ruin the walls with screw holes or ruin them with adhesive residue.  I overcame this issue by using the temporary adhesive strips that you pull to release, but I'm sure that the manufacturer would not approve.  As far as the function of the gate goes, it's great.  It's easy to open with one hand and the self-closing feature is nice so that you can't forget to close it behind you.

6142,"I really like this baby food maker! As a first time mom, I had no idea how much baby food I would actually make or how difficult it might be. The Babycook is easy to use and super cute! I noticed some reviewers said they found mold in the water basin, but mine does not.  I have cleaned it with white vinegar as the directions say, but I also leave the lid off of the water basin for a little while after using it so it can dry out. My only complaint is that I sometimes wish the cooking bowl was bigger. I can usually only fit 1 pear in it at a time, and if I have 3 pears to cook, it takes 3 cooking cycles.",X_train
6143,"This is a great stoller as a single. What I wish I knew before I bought it was that it really doesn't convert well to a double. If that is a factor for you in deciding between this and another stroller that doesn't convert, you'd might as well factor it out... When you put the rumble seat on, there isn't much head clearance between it and the main seat (both seats also have to face the parent). The only way to get decent head clearance is for the main seat to be fully upright, which is not appropriate for my 3 month old baby. Perhaps if you had two toddlers you could use this stroller as a double, but with a toddler and baby don't bother with the rumble seat.<br /><br />Considering the poor usability of the rumble seat, this stroller is comparable to other nice single strollers that don't have the conversion option. In that case, I wonder if I should have bought a Chameleon. The Chameleon is an inch or two narrower and has air-filled wheels. The width and the wheels are the two things I do not like about the Vista. Fortunately, they are the only two things I don't like about it. Aside from that, this is an AWESOME stroller:<br /><br />-great height - baby sits up higher than most strollers (an advantage over the bugaboo). We even use ours in the house and roll her up to the table so she can see us at meal times, or roll her into the kitchen to watch me cook<br />-easy to steer and push<br />-lots of recline positions (in the 2012 model), one-hand recline<br />-peek-a-boo window (bugaboo doesn't have one)<br />-adjustable footrest<br />-bassinet and seat are separate pieces so you can use both without switching the fabric (chameleon is one frame that converts)<br />-fold is so easy! there's no \\""technique\\"" you just hold a button with one hand and give the handle bar a little push with the other. just need to push handle bar in (like telescoping), not down. easy.<br />-enormous basket - makes the stroller look a little big but it's convenient and easy to find stuff inyour basket<br />-easy to switch seat back and forth - I actually prefer this one over bugaboo's memory buttons because it's easier to set the seat back in<br /><br />My baby and toddler both love riding in this stroller (but separately, since we returned the rumble seat). IF ONLY UPPABABY WOULD SELL REPLACEMENT AIR TIRES!! Also I find it a little tricky to get up and down curbs - it has to be tipped quite a bit.<br /><br />Oh, and a word about the Piggyback board. It's not bad, but not as nice as I expected coming from Uppababy. It rattles a lot going down the sidewalk and doesn't fold away as easily as I would have liked. It's kind of a pain, actually. You have to strap it to the footrest, and the footrest has to be all the way down. But my son rides on it for short trips if his legs get tired and he likes it well enough. I just don't like leaving it on the stroller if I'm not going to need it.<br /><br />I'm happy with this stroller, but I still wonder if I should have gone with the Chameleon - mostly for the air-filled tires! I compromised on the tires so that I could have a convertible stroller, which didn't pan out since the rumble seat is useless. Ah well.",X_train
6144,I bought these containers because I was pureeing food at home for my 6 month old son.  They are nice because they can be put through the dishwasher and they store easily.

Too little and it's your classic water downed coffee substitute and too much and it goes a little bitter.

Attempts to chew can lead to frustration, but my son seemed to &#34;learn&#34; the cause-and-effect of shake to hear the rattle pretty quickly.

6238,"I loved my regular ultimate crib sheets, but after a year the snaps started to break on one, so I needed another. The organic version was cheaper so I opted for it, but it's not as good. It's either shrunk or wasn't as big to begin with (I think the problem is shrinkage though). I wash my kids' sheets in hot water, and when I put this on the crib it is about 2 inches short both ways. Because of the elastic on the snaps it works OK, but it's harder to put on and because of the gap my son messes with the sides more than the other version.     I say go with the regular version until they get the sizing right on this one.",X_train
6239,"Perfect all around olive oil. We cook with it, use it as a skin and massage oil, salad dressing, and even as a kinky hair fix. Flavor is rich and clean and just perfect as a all purpose, high quality oil.",X_train

6243,This one is ok. It's patchy sound and unclear quality make for frustrating scenarios sometimes but seeing as how we got it for a good deal on cyber Monday it was worth it.

6248,"I am not a fan of polyester. Having said that, I bought this set because my kids LOVE trains and the reviews were good. When I tried it out, the pillow cover and sheet kept shifting and didn't stay in place due to the fabric. I have a cotton fitted sheet from Pottery Barn and it stays in place much better. I am sending this back. The print and style is very good and it is awesome for the price, but I just don't like polyester, I prefer cotton sheets since they seem to stay in place much better and seem more breathable.",X_train

They fold up out of the way when baby is not in the room, so you don't have a clungy gate for everyone to walk through every time they want to get in and out of a room. Easy set up. The latch system takes some getting used to, but I feel confident my daughter won't be opening this gate for as long as we need it.",X_train

Unless she steps in it dead center and stays centered (so.etching I can't always do on a stool), it tips over.",X_train
6271,"This is a gorgeous necklace that is perfect for a teething little one!  The beads are small which is nice because they aren't heavy and they look nice with any outfit.  I love that the beads don't have knots between them so they can't move and all get stuck on one end of the necklace which can be very frustrating.  It comes with a breakaway clasp which is nice for peace of mind since my kids like to wear anything they find sitting around.  I was very excited to read in the description that it wouldn't snag on my hair, however I didn't find this to be the case.  It pulled out a lot of my hair!!  Overall though, I love this necklace and would absolutely recommend it.<br /><br />I got this item at a discounted price for leaving an unbiased review.",X_train
6272,Smells great.  Sweet but not too sweet.  I use this on my body and face. I love Jason's products.,X_train

6275,"I have tried Cafix, Caf-Lib, and Dandy Blend, and Dandy Blend has become my favorite.<br /><br />The first thing you must do when trying coffee substitutes is to set your expectations. The reviews I read said these products tasted like coffee. They do not taste like any coffee I have ever had. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you are expecting a coffee-like taste when you try one of these, you will be disappointed. I drank my coffee black, and so that is how I prepared these. Perhaps with sweetener and/or creamer these do taste more like coffee.<br /><br />If you are looking for a warm beverage to drink in the place of coffee, Dandy Blend and Caf-Lib are my top two favorites. Try them both to discover which one you prefer.",X_train

6277,"In my experiences buying these at the store, the ones with the twist off caps had the problem of smelling/tasting like sour milk. It listed milk as an ingredient right on the can. But the pop top cans never had this problem and also never listed milk as an ingredient. I figured they must have changed the formula. Plus, reading the code on the bottom of the can showed that the twist off cap style were made in 2012. At least every one I had seen. So I thought i had this all figured out, the twist offs were just expired or a different formula altogether. I buy the pop top cans every day at the local gas station. I don't even see the twist off style anymore. So I figured it was safe to subscribe on Amazon so I didn't have to stop at the store every day plus risk them being out of it.<br /><br />I did indeed receive the pop top cans from Amazon, which is what's pictured in the listing. However, they suffer from the sour milk taste/smell. It's undrinkable. So for those who understand what that's all about, you don't want to order from Amazon.<br /><br />I compared the can from Amazon to the one from the store that tasted normal, and the only difference at all was the code stamped on the bottom of the can. They appeared quite different, clearly not stamped by the same machines, so I wonder if they're made in different locations and maybe that has something to do with it.<br /><br />So disappointed, I hate stopping at the store all the time for these.",X_train

6282,"Item arrived on time. I am not sure how it works with my lil guys reflux and teething symptoms yet. Quality is great, my only complaint is the clasp is very hard to take off and on.

6283,"I received a bag of this as a bonus/free sample for buying Pop Chips (Medora).  HOLY MOLY!  These have a great taste and blows other chips out of the water!  They don't feel heavy after eating, don't have oils or dust to leave on your hand, taste amazing like tortilla with sesame, salt, and ground black pepper, and just tastes wonderful.  If it was cheaper, I would never pick up any other bags of chips again.  Whenever I have a craving, I end up picking up regular tortilla chips, Doritos, or Pop Chips just because I can't afford to eat these multigrain chips all the time, but I always feel like I'm settling for a lesser product.  These multigrain chips are the holy grail of chips.  I may consider asking for a raise at work or switching careers just to gain more funds to cover the cost of these.  It's worth it.",X_train
6284,"Love this monitor!! So easy to use and I especially love that the monitor is paired with the parent unit so I can take it anywhere. I live on a half care and I can still use the monitor at the far end of my property with great sound and picture quality.<br />Best features:<br />Automute when no change in sound level for a few seconds, so we don't have to listen to the white noise machine next to his crib while we sleep.<br />You can adjust brightness and sound levels.<br />Talking into it is easy and baby loves hearing from us.<br />Adjustable kickstand on back<br />Temperature on screen<br />Great battery life<br /><br />Only negative slightly annoying to find a good spot to hang this on baby room wall and the camera has to be manually moved by hand to see other areas because the cam downy pan/tilt on its own just zoom.",X_train

I like the dried raisins in there.<br /><br />I'm really not a picky eater, but I also don't just eat something to eat it.<br /><br />It's a product that acts as a nice substitute for those who are trying to avoid the added calories of peanut butter, but still like that little taste of a snack here and there. I haven't tried it in large scoops or on anything. Just little tasty teaspoons :)<br /><br />I'll buy it again.",X_train

I LOVE the feature where the stroller seat can be front facing or rear facing.  It is so easy to move it around (though you cannot change it while child is sitting in it).  ONLY CON is that it is heavy, but I don't mind at all.  Where do I need to carry a stroller.  I consider it my daily workout getting it in and out of the trunk.  It is a bit bulky too.  Might have a hard time fitting it in a smaller car trunk.  My husband loves it too because its' \\""cool\\"" looking, and he's a tall guy, so he finds the handles at a good height for him.

I read all the reviews on this product and was a bit concerned I might not like it, but decided to try it anyway. I need to lose weight and have painful arthritis in one hip. I'm trying to cut down on foods that cause inflammation to lessen the pain levels. I've been on almost every diet there is and have found it difficult to give up so much of the food I love. So, when I read about Miracle Noodles I was a bit skeptical...0 calories??? 0 carbs??? Gluten free??? How could that be???<br /><br />Well..I was very pleased with my first attempt at cooking with these. First of all...when I opened the package, expecting a dreadful odor (per other reviewers), I was quite pleasantly surprised that I couldn't detect any odor at all...perhaps that was an anomaly, but there it is!!! (BTW...I have a pretty good sense of smell, so that wasn't the reason I wasn't smelling the \\""fishy\\"" odor other reviewers stressed.) I prepared the fettuccini noodles, as instructed, and tasted one. Truly, they have no taste by themselves. The texture is a bit like a soft gummy...I certainly wouldn't call them \\""slimy.\\"" I cut up a chicken breast and some onions and garlic and sauteed them in some extra-virgin olive oil, seasoning with salt, pepper and Bragg's Liquid Amino (which tastes like a very mild, far less salty, soy sauce or tamari, for those not acquainted with it), and stirred in the noodles after they had been drained and placed on paper towels (there was no sticking to the pan I \\""cooked\\"" them in or to the paper towels...nice!!!) I REALLY enjoyed the meal...it was satisfying, and I felt \\""comfortably full\\"". The noodles took on the flavors of the rest of the mixture. I ate them for breakfast (strange breakfast...I know... :) ) and wasn't hungry for the rest of the day, but ate a late supper when my husband arrived home after a meeting (after 9 pm).<br /><br />I am looking forward to trying the rice and angel hair.

6392,"Ok, so I bought these to brew my own coffee on the Keurig B40 in December 2013. I'm not a coffee snob, but I would like to get a good cup of coffee without having to pay more than $0.50/K-cup. When I first bought these, I had some problems getting a strong brew and at times I would go back to the K-cups. I didn't have my own grinder at the time so I would grind the beans at the store-provided commercial blade grinder. I tried everything from coarse auto-drip to almost super-fine espresso but it seemed that nothing would give me a strong brew (even tried brewing at the smallest cup setting). The coarser grinds tended to be a little better but it was still really weak compared to a K-cup brew.<br /><br />After getting the same results with the Brewooze refillable cups, I got a manually-operated Hario slim burr grinder a few weeks ago. That was a game-changer. On its default factory setting, I got excellent, very strong coffee both at the 8 and 10 oz cup settings! The folks that say that &#34;It's all in the grind&#34; are right. Switching to a burr grinder has made all the difference. It's made a convert out of me. Burr grinders seem to extract the flavor  better and its definitely noticeable for me.  I estimate that the setting is to a medium to medium fine ground and it works. I'm writing this review in August 2015 and I think Brew & Save has another offering that has more refillable cups than this listing. I wouldn't mind buying this again, but I'd go with another refillable cup if it has cheaper and had similar or better ratings since, again, it's more about getting a good grind than the refillable itself.

There is a hint of chocolate mixed in with a grainy, grassy, dirt flavor. It also says something about &#34;new improved texture&#34;. I definitely recommend using a blender, almond milk/milk, coffee or something with some other flavor besides water to mask the actual taste of what you will be drinking. Maybe a banana? get to that below.<br /><br />For myself I currently use almond milk mixed with a teaspoon of another vegetarian protein powder and this makes it palatable.

I am a petite sized woman so I find a teaspoon plus a teaspoon of my other veg. protein powder works for me.<br /><br />I have been taking this for a couple weeks and really notice a difference in how I feel, my energy level has increased, and cravings have decreased A LOT! I work out everyday, eat very healthy but even individuals such as myself are prone to those &#34;I only had couple cookies&#34; when it may have actually more than a &#34;couple&#34;...then leads to the dreaded extra long workout.<br /><br />I have found with traditional protein powders in the past something lacking, and usually hungry after an hour. I find it tedious to add fruits to make a smoothie when this is already loaded with everything you could imagine. I can see adding half a banana?? to mask.

6423,"I agree the top seam is tight if I push right up on it, but I'm short enough in the torso and long enough in the next that it doesn't really bother me personally.  I find myself really sleeping easier with it, I was waking up constantly, readjusting pillows, etc.  It takes up a lot of room in the bed yes, but I keep it with the long closed side towards the outside of the bed all the time - Hubby works around it to still support my back and cuddle in as we fall asleep, then if I roll at night it supports my back, so it's a win win for us.  Plus, with all the other configurations you can use it for, I think in the long run we will absolutely get our money back out of it.",X_test

I bought the last bag in the case and there were no more to be had.  We cant get these in Florida :(  All of the Larry the Cable Guy potato chips are okay to good but these are so delicious.,X_test
6428,This was a great product at first. There is a lot of  sound choices and very intricate pictures on the projector slides. It also has a built in night light which was helpful.

If they make it a better quality it would be a great product. For me. Two fails.,X_test

6432,"We have a Honda Odyssey.  We have baby #5 on the way in a few weeks.  All of our kids are still in car seats.  The only empty spot was on the back row, between two Britax car seats.  We tried putting the 5th car seat there, but there wasn't room.      We really didn't want to buy a new vehicle when there ARE five spots in the back for our five kids.  Someone mentioned these car seats, so we decided to give them a try.      We were a little bit worried from other reviews that they wouldn't fit securely in our van.  We are very picky about our car seats not budging!  So, we decided to give them a try.    We bought three of these car seats to fit in the back row - for our three oldest kids.  My husband is the one who installed them.  He said it was very quick and easy, BUT the top part was pretty wiggly.  He's fairly experienced in putting car seats in and tried many things to get them in tightly.  It wasn't secure enough.  We don't have the LATCH system on the back row, nor do we have tethers.  So, we couldn't use either of those to secure it in.  We use the locking clip \\""Mighty Tite\\"" to secure them in tightly and it works well.  You can probably use any type of locking clip to secure them in if you have a car seat that you can't get in tight enough.",X_test

When it first arrived, the lights flashed as the song played--all was well and she loved it, especially the lights.  Gradually, however, one after another of the lights failed over 2-4 months. The music is still lilting and lovely, the bee on the pull string very cute, but the lights are gone and along with it the enchantment.  I consider this a \\""failed\\"" product, but then, my fault for not believing the reviews and taking a risk.",X_test

6436,"Came in a single large bag contained in a cardboard box. Clean, no unwanted objects or organisms. Got here sooner than expected. Tastes great after toasting for a few minutes and cooking as I would any other cereal. Tastes even better after soaking for a day in yogurt and blending for use as pancake batter. The kids love the taste and we could probably write a cookbook based on all the recipes we've come up with. If there are any cons, I'd have preferred a better bag. We're lucky the bag held up as well as it did but it looked as though it was on the verge of breaking. We had to bag the groats up into seperate resealable bags right away.",X_test

6438,"We've had this for a few months now and our 10 1/2 month old daughter has always been on the petite side, which is good, because I don't think a larger baby would fit in this.  The toys are somewhat flimsy and uninteresting; I've always had to put extra toys on the try to keep her occupied while I get her food ready.  I have used this in place of a high chair at times and it's worked great for that.  I just sit on the floor and feed her.  Of course cleaning it up is a pain, but it's not intended for use as a high chair so I have to accept that.  As far as rolling/using it as a walker, it's kind of difficult to maneuver and get it to roll, even on hardwood floors.  She has figured out how to go backward as is common in most babies.  Overall I would rate this product as \\""OK\\"".  I am unsure if I would buy it again.",X_test
6439,"Very good lemonade mix.  Close to fresh in taste.  Love that it has stevia.  I like it so much more than crystal light or any of the other mixes with artificial sweeteners.  I can take it anywhere, mix it in bottled water, and have a refreshing, healthy, safe, cool drink.",X_test

6441,"I use the Natural Brown, 2 cup Melitta filter paper and a Melitta cone to make the best coffee this side of anywhere. Of course, it is necessary to use the best coffee, and that can only be found at Peet's. The coffee must be ground very fine, and since I like strong coffee, I use two scoops to make one cup.<br />OK, here's the rest of the drill: First insert the filter paper in the cone, position it over the cup and fill with hot water. The hot water rinses the filter and preheats the cup. Next, add two scoops (or one and a half if you like your coffee weaker)and lightly tamp it down to pack it but do not tear the filter. Pour the hot water out of the cup. Replace the filter and coffee over the cup and add a small amount of hot water, wetting the grounds. DO NOT USE BOILING HOT WATER! Boiling hot water dissolves acids and makes the coffee bitter. The water temperature should be about 180 to 190 Fahrenheidt. After the first bit of water had drained into the cup, add more water.<br />Even if you have been used to adding sugar to your coffee, please try it without. There will be no bitterness and in fact, you can make the coffee stronger than you ever imagined and there'll be no bitterness.<br />You are welcome!",X_test

I just recently heard about the blood type diet; for my blood type, I am supposed to stay away from corn products and potato products--try that in the United States when you really want something salty and crunchy without making it yourself--you just want a snack that makes you feel like you just ruined your diet.

The [[ASIN:B005VBD4BA Campbell's Red & White Tomato Soup, 15.2-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)]] came out to $1.295 a can (free Prime shipping) AND it's got more in the can.  I use the [[ASIN:B0038QL890 Cool Touch Microwave Bowl]]. A regular can of soup fits quite leaving plenty of room at the top.  These 15.2 ounce cans fill the bowl, with just a little left at the top.<br /><br />BUT ... keep in mind that it's not necessarily the healthiest food. Not only does it have a lot of sodium (which pretty much all processed foods do, unfortunately), but it's got a LOT more carbs than I could have imagined: 20g, 12g of that is sugar.  Yikes!

Some things about the Waltz that won us over are:  You can access the basket even when the seat is fully reclined (unlike the Maclaren Techno we almost bought).  The wheels are bigger than most other strollers in its class.  The seat fully reclines for a sleeping baby  It came with a cup holder, foot muff, and a rain cover.

My mother, who normally won't drink hot cocoa, had me buy her some of her own. If I add less sugar it's also healthier.

I put it under a plant lamp and two days later I had seedlings.<br /><br />The only problem is that I sort of stirred the dirt around with my finger looking for signs of life.

We bought this one because we found it for a good price, it doesn't have the bar across the bottom and we liked the slim design.<br /><br />Upon installation, however we discovered the screws are worthless.  The first one we tried to use broke.  That did not surprise us because we had read the reviews.  We wanted to see for ourselves and sure enough... those screws are worthless. My husband is a Carpenter by trade so he just went into the garage and got longer and stronger screws.<br /><br />We've had this gate installed for 3 months now and we still love it.

I think it was the chili powder, but I can't be sure.<br /><br />Secondly, they are quite small and would be difficult to really \\""scoop\\"" any sort of dip with them.<br /><br />Thirdly, they are not all the same size.  Some of the crackers were 1 inch long, which is really small for a cracker.<br /><br />Fourthly they really smell like doggie biscuits.<br /><br />Like there is an uncanny resemblance in the smell to doggie biscuits!<br /><br />Fifth and the most serious of the issues, is the fact that 70-80% of the crackers came all crumbed in the box.<br /><br />I literally had to sift through the rubble to find a few whole crackers to eat.  The rest is good for nothing more than throwing on top of a soup or stew.<br /><br />If only 10-20% were crumbed it wouldn't be so bad, but the majority of them were crumbed up.<br /><br />Not cool.<br /><br />And on top of it, I bought two boxes and they BOTH were crumbled up.<br /><br />Perhaps it happened during shipment, who knows.

6593,"Let me start of by saying, wow... what a wonderful idea for a product! It's an absolute shame that it has a few minor flaws that kind of ruin it.<br /><br />Initial setup and cleaning the machine was fairly easy, but it's very important that you adhere closely to the instructions. There is a wheel inside that &#34;scoops&#34; formula to be mixed to the proper consistency, and if you do not set it properly your baby's bottles will not come out with the proper ratio of dry formula to water. If you take the time to acknowledge this, everything SHOULD work perfectly.<br /><br />I say should for a reason. Despite closely following the instruction manual, setting everything to specifications for our babies' formula, and maintaining the machine daily as suggested, there were concerns after the first couple of days about the formula not being mixed properly. Our concerns were quickly validated after about a week when the formula had gone from milky white to looking like cloudy water. After dismantling the machine for a full cleaning, it became very clear what the problem was. The &#34;chute&#34; that combines the formula and water either splashes up or somehow otherwise allows moisture to enter the compartment that the dry formula is stored in.<br /><br />Baby formula is highly sensitive to moisture, so that little bit of water or steam caused the powder to solidify like dried paste to the bottom of the container. Even though we cleaned the part that dispenses the mixed formula on a daily basis, this significantly constricted the amount of powder that dropped down to be mixed in the first place. In hindsight, I'm sure this could have been cleaned out daily as well... but you probably would have had to stick a butter knife or something similar up into there. Even then there is the risk of pushing old, crusty formula back into the food that your baby is eventually going to end up consuming.<br /><br />After thorough cleaning of the entire machine, I ensured that there was no moisture whatsoever on or in any of the parts. It was re-assembled and used for no more than 2 days before the same problem began to occur. We brought the product back to the store it was purchased at without hesitation and have happily prepared our babies' bottles by hand ever since. At least now we know they are getting the proper nutrition that they need.<br /><br />It's also notable that during the time we used this machine, our power bill increased significantly.<br /><br />If it weren't for the moisture problem and the power usage, this baby food maker could have been a 5-star product all day long. The convenience factor alone is worth it's weight in gold.moisture whatsoever on or in any of the parts. It was re-assembled and used for no more than 2 days before the same problem began to occur.

Would I like a bigger screen on the parents unit, sure, would I love to move the childs camera via the  parents unit, sure, would I like to connect to my iPhone, sure but for the price, it works well and I am happy with it.",X_test

6636,"I thought this one seemed like a great idea - it's tall, self-closing, not plastic.  But the self-closing thing, as it turns out, is more trouble than it's worth.  Annoying: In the morning, for example, when I'm running upstairs a thousand times to get 'one last thing,' and baby is downstairs all morning, I don't want to deal with the gate clanging shut behind me or opening it up when I have arms full of stuff.  Noisy: The gate's hinge is loud - I'm sure I would apply some WD40 if I were to keep it, but it's brand new (and we're not keeping it).  Louder still is the sound it makes when I shut the gate.  Even if I'm super careful, there are contact points up top and at the bottom that are metal-on-metal.  If those parts had been plastic or somehow padded, it would be a better model.  Weak: But it still wouldn't fit our hallway.  We decided to block the hallway next to the top of the stairs instead of the exact top of the stairs - works better for full hands to have a nice landing up there.  Although this gate says it can be expanded the full range, the truth is that right in between sizes the gate is either really weak (the little bolts that screw out are wobbly when the gate is pushed on) or if we add the other section, the gate is too big.",X_test

The size two diapers are a lot bigger.  We had to put them aside for a bit.  At 15 pounds and 26 inches they are starting to fit, but still really wide between the legs.

6671,"I have never written a review for Amazon but I saw some of the poor reviews on the Diaper Champ and had to add my two cents . . .  <br /> <br />When my sister got pregnant she could not decide if she should register for the Diaper Champ or the Diaper Genie.  She left it up to me and after reviewing both items I went with the Diaper Champ . . .  The idea of having to continually purchase bags for the Diaper Genie seemed like a waste when the Diaper Champ lets you use any type of bag . . .  My nephew is now over two years old and while he has begun potty training, my sister still uses the Diaper Champ I gave her . . .  <br /> <br />When it came time for me to choose a diaper disposal system, I put the Diaper Champ on my registry.  Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?  True, the mechanism sometimes won't \\""swing\\"" the dirty diaper into the pail but HELLO that is a sign that it is probably time to put in a new bag.  Yes, it can eventually start to smell if you don't change it regularly . . . but then again if you used a metal safe lined with carbon to hold your kids diapers eventually baby poop and pee smell would emanate from it if you didn't clean it out regularly . . . Realistically the thing holds dirty stinky diapers and yep it is going to smell when you open it but hey . . . my kids tush smells when I wipe it but I still love him :) <br /> <br />My personal tip . . . if you belong to a wholesale club like BJ's, Costco or Sam's check to see if they have the Glad Kitchen Bags.  The BJ's we shop in has a box of 200 for $9.99.  As long as you do not attempt to overstuff them (i.e., get lazy and don't change the bag regularly) they work perfectly.  I also use them in the small garbage pails in our apartment.  I could wait for a sale and use a coupon (the way I shop for most things) but it takes months to go through the box and I like knowing they are always on hand . . . At about $.05 a bag, the super duper box of bags makes my life easy and that as any parent knows is ***PRICELESS***.",X_test

6700,"I bought this swing because I was looking for a travel swing to bring places.  Since we already have an expensive swing; I tried to save money and purchse a lesser expensive swing - bad mistake.  This swing took over 2 + hours to put together and was difficult.  The product seems cheap.  My 8 week old child kept sliding down in the swing; although I had strapped him into the harness system (difficult and time consuming as well).  Although my child has good physical development for his age; he kept sliding down.  The swing provided no support at all. Now that I want to return the swing; it is even more challenging to take apart.   Take my advice, don't try to save money on baby equiptment!",X_test

6702,"I have bought walnuts at various places, looking for quality at the best price. This brand is as good as any others I've found. Sam's currently carries them at $14.00 for the 32 ounce bag. That is a dollar less than the bulk price at my nearest organic shop (Truck Patch), and considerably cheaper than I have found in other places. Amazon's price is not horrible if you presume that shipping is included in the price. If you have to pay for shipping, there are better prices -- as mentioned above. (This is no &#34;slam&#34; on Amazon, just facts. I have found Amazon to be extremely helpful and plan to do business with them for the foreseeable future.)<br /><br />You will run into a bad nut every so often, but this is true in nearly every bag I have found, no matter the brand. Other than that, the flavor of these nuts is better than I have found elsewhere and I will continue to buy this brand until and unless the quality declines. Certainly worth a try in my opinion.",X_test

Really opens up after three or four weeks when it  develops a bouquet like a Prussian cavalry stable, though loses its beautiful tearing properties in its curd-like state. Palate of white, steamed rice. Faint after taste of bovine teat. Canonical pairing is packeted biscuits but those keen on adventure will match it with high-acidity lemon or lime squash. Tuscan Whole Milk is very similar in structure and overall body to its mountainous cousin Montepulciano Latte Nobile but lacks the sugar-forward properties of its brother vintage, Tuscan Chocolate.  Overall impressions: a fine example of lactose-forward, mammary-secreted Italian-mammalian fluid. 4 Stars.",X_test

This makes this item an ugly gift for someone unless you were expecting to repack the K-Cups yourself prior to handing them over.<br /><br />The bag also provides no protection to the K-Cups, and one of them was crushed - although not sufficiently as to be unusable.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a good purchase.",X_test

This is a huge bag of candy, so there will be plenty to go around and then some, whatever your needs. I know there has been some discussion regarding the use of both corn syrup and sugar being used as a sweetener in these candies, but I suggest people just follow their own nutritional regimen and requirements.

I have used it on my son for about a month and really like it except that it stings his eyes.  He would start to fuss, cry, and say &#34; owie&#34; when I washed his hair and face with it.  At first I thought he was just being difficult but then I washed my face with it and it really stung my eyes!  At least he could tell me that it was hurting him, but a newborn would not be able to.

6733,"Just assembled this today for newly arrived baby girl. First, the control panel was loose from the body due to a broken tab. I did not realize this at first and just snapped it into place thinking it was supposed to come that way. Later I found the broken tab among the plastic. Assembly was fairly straight forward until I got to the last tube which was missing the little plastic bolt grommet thingy. Found it in one of the cardboard protective pieces and luckily it fit on to the tube so I could complete the assembly. Then I plug it in, start the motor and wow does this sound like it's powered by popsicle sticks and rubber bands. I assume it's broken due to A) the broken tab on the motor/control panel and B) the loud noise. Then I come here and see this is a common issue. If it lasts and she likes it then I'll forgive and forget, but as it is now I wish I had purchased one locally just in case any of these issues come back to haunt me a few months from now.<br /><br />Oh last thing, this is a BIG piece of equipment so be prepared for that.

6751,"UPDATE!!  The seller contacted me promptly and let me know where the sling is made.  It is in Spain.  They also stated that there are videos for the other tie styles on their website.  Because of this I changed the rating to 5 stars.  :)  I gave this 4 stars for the reason that I thought this was made in the USA because of the name.  I know this is more my fault, but since I cannot find the origin anywhere and it was misleading in the title I give this product 4 stars.  I tried looking on the packaging for the made origin and cannot find it.  I would just like to know out of curiosity.  The material is thicker than I thought, but our winters get very cold here in Indiana, so I am completely fine with that.  Other than that, the sling seems like it will work just fine for my new soon to be.  I bought the grey one, and it is a nice color.  It is a solid grey color, not heather grey if you were curious.  There is no marking to let you know where the middle is.  I just drew a heart on the inside after I found the middle.  If it washes out, I'll sew on a button.  The sling is long!  So I don't see it being a problem for anyone to be able to use, small or large.  One thing I wish it had was instructions on the different sling tie styles that can be used.  If I'm not mistaken I thought these types of slings could be used newborn through 35 lbs, but the tie style needs be changed.  There is only the newborn/front facing style (or the one in the main picture).",X_test

It was really neat!!  :)  It seems to pick up and read the mother's pulse more readily, which I think interferes with the count on the LCD.  It was reading my pulse at 68, and the baby at around 130.  But I counted my pulse, and it was around 85, and the baby was consistently at 170ish.  So, you can clearly hear both heartbeats, but I wouldn't rely on the screen for an accurate reading.  That said, I would recommend this product b/c you can hear the heartbeat pretty early and put your mind at ease.  I think the model A is the same thing without the LCD screen and a little cheaper, so that may be the route to go.

6795,"I splurged on this pillow for myself late in my pregnancy but it just didn't work for me. I think I'm too tall for it (I'm about 5'9\\""), so the bottom part of the pillow wrapped between my legs higher than I would have liked (I would have preferred it to wrap more between my knees than between my thighs). Also, because of my long torso my belly isn't very big, and although it does need support while I sleep it did not stick out far enough to take advantage of the part of the pillow designed to support the belly. After one night of terrible sleep I gave up on this pillow.  Even though it didn't work for me I do think it's a good product/great idea. I do wish it wrapped around the back in some way so that the user would really only need the one pillow to be comfortable all night, but it's wonderfully fluffy and the cover was a pretty, calm pattern and was easy to get on and off.    In the end I gifted it to a friend who recently found out she was pregnant. I hope it works for her!",X_test

She's probably 24\\"" now at 3.5 months and her feet are hanging over the edge.  This concerns me in so far as how soon I'm going to have to buy another car seat.  I was hoping to get a year out of it, but it's not looking like it!!  My real gripe about this product has more to do with the actual stroller system it connects to which I have also reviewed.  So if you are here, as I arrived here, to buy the matching car seat to match the Mia Moda stroller then I'd advise you to look for a different system.  Seriously.",X_test

6816,"I have back problems so was looking for a medium sized bag that would be comfortable to carry, and this one has been great.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1.  It is the perfect size--fits everything I need but doesn't feel like I'm lugging around a suitcase.  Actually it could hold a lot more than I carry in it, as I'm trying to keep it light because of my back problems.  It has plenty of pockets to keep things organized.<br /><br />2.  The strap is very comfortable--it is well padded and has a non-slip surface that keeps it on my shoulder.  It is comfortable on one shoulder or slung across my chest.<br /><br />3.  It comes with hooks that you attach to the handles of your stroller.  At first I thought this was silly, but it's now one of my favorite features.  It keeps the bag securely within easy reach and high enough that I don't kick it when walking.  If I hung it by the strap it would be too low, and it's a hassle to get it in and out of the basket, so I love these hooks.<br /><br />4.  We have the \\""Black Stitch\\"" color, and it is neutral enough to be for a boy or a girl and sleek enough that I still feel like a professional adult when I carry it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  The changing pad is surprisingly heavy.  It is large, which is nice, but keeping the bag light is a priority to me so I use a lighter one.<br /><br />2.  The pockets on the side are small--I have to push hard to get a 20oz water bottle in them.<br /><br />3.  I wish it had a short handle in addition to the shoulder strap--it would sometimes be easier to haul everything if it did.<br /><br />One note, the price on Amazon seems to fluctuate by as much as twenty dollars, so I would keep an eye on it and buy it when it's less expensive.",X_test

6819,"I wasn't sure I would like this tea; but I took a chance after reading some reviews regarding the &#34;Hot&#34; in the &#34;Hot Cinnamon Spice&#34;. It was sounding like it just might be something I could enjoy. So as soon as it arrived I opened it up and took a whiff, OMG, it smelled absolutely divine and spicey! I was very careful with the measurement of tea, the water temp and infuse time. I wanted the first cup to be per instructions so I could then adjust accordingly to my own personal taste. Well that first cup was an experience, It smelled exquisite, my first sip was soon after infusing and it was steaming hot. It was almost too sweet, I don't ever use sweetener in anything, not a big fan; but the sweet cloves in it was very sweet and not sure how I felt about that. After the tea cooled to a more drinkable temperature, my holey tea-bud, it was a thousand times better than that first sip. The sweetness was tempered and all the flavors came together in a wonderful balance. The &#34;Hot&#34; Cinnamon got spicey and I loved it. It was a great cup of tea all the way down to the last drop. Well almost the last drop, it has so much cinnamon in it that it does have a little more tea sediment than most loose teas, but it was such a fine dusting that it was still drinkable to the last drop. That last drop just has a little kick. So my final grade is A+++. My personal adjustment is a heaping &#34;perfect teaspoon&#34; per cup (I like it strong and spicy), I do keep to the 5 minute suggested brew time. I do hold my anticipation in check and wait until it is a drinkable temp so I can avoid that first saccharin sweet effect of the clove it gets when it's too hot. Then it is perfect start to finish. I am going through it way too fast. I will be reordering very soon. It is my favorite afternoon wind-down tea and also my afternoon need-a-second-wind tea, whichever the day requires. What else can I say, I love this tea, and yes, the cinnamon is deliciously spicy, yum!",X_test

You may.

When I was picking out a swaddler blanket for my daughter I was told to stick with the Aden and Anais blankets because they are the best and the most versatile.<br />I shopped around and found these ones- thinking that since they are more expensive they are probably the 'better' ones to get. Boy was I wrong. Yes, when you open the box and touch the fabric they are super soft and luxurious but when you swaddle your baby- the blanket does not hold in place and in a funny way is slippery.<br />Then you go and wash it.<br />I washed it as instructed on the tag. But it came out pimply and stringy. The fabric now looks old and definitely not like it was barely used once.<br />I would stick to the basic cotton swaddle blankets from aden and anais.

I think for that price it was a perfect item. I am sad to see it being sold for $73. I do not think it is worth $73 dollars.<br />The orange platform is misleading - it is not bouncy.

Upon visiting Amazon to review the product, I found that a previous reviewer, RDToo had already recommended the liquid reduction I used!  So, I hand credit for the idea to RDToo!<br /><br />I'm giving the product three stars because of the required amendment to the cooking instructions in order to make a side dish with good taste and texture.

This is a great and affordable decor option for anyone, but especially for those who like to change up decor every so often or if you rent and can't apply permanent paint or decor to your walls. It's also way easier than painting a design like this on the wall. We love it!<br /><br />I made sure to follow the instructions by first washing and drying the wall really well - especially since it is textured so it's always a bit tougher to apply decals on texture. I've applied vinyl decals before so I didn't really need to consult the instructions for the application, but if you have never done this before, definitely read the instructions and view the Bobee instructional video.<br /><br />It was pretty easy to apply, although they didn't include a plastic scraper tool that helps get the vinyl to stick without air bubbles, so I used a credit card instead.

Just before he set to \\""modifying\\"" this to MAKE it work he discovered it will only fit on the handle when the handle is extended. Pull your handle out and part of it will be exposed that does not have the rubber cushion. THIS is where it must go. Yes you loose one extension section of your handle bar but it's not that bad. The handle will still extend one more section. I generally liked having the handle at it's shortest but having it extended to the first position really isn't that big a deal or difference. If it REALLY bugs you then you could trim the handle bar cushion to allow for the cup holder and then never remove the cup holder. The fact that the cup holder part can come on and off with the twist of a knob is really handy as well if you don't want to break it off when stowing the stroller.<br />All in all for what's available for the City Select (and it's precious little) this is a decent product.",X_test

6863,"I have only used this carrier since my daughter has been big enough to wear on my back, but it is amazing.  She is very comfortable in it, and the weight is distributed so evenly for me that it's like she weighs nothing.  I am 5'0\\"" and 105lbs, so carrying a 30lb child on my back while hiking, and even just walking around town, would throw off my balance with other carriers... but not with the Ergo.  I really really love this carrier.  I am about to have a little boy, just ordered the infant insert for my Ergo, and cannot wait to try it as a front carrier.  I will update this eventually :)",X_test

I also have a 3 year old (37 1/2 in, 31 lbs), wearing 3T.  This is huge for the 3 year old.  I can't say I'd get a smaller size, because I don't know what I'd get, but they can grow into this. Love the fabric and the idea, as we live in Alaska and take the kids to a remote cabin in the woods where it can get kind of chilly.",X_test
6866,Our 5 month old baby loves both of these products! The music from the BE Take A Long Tunes are pleasant to listen to and teaches him coordination by pressing the button to start the classical music.  He absolutely loves the Jumper though.  He can go for 45+ minutes just bouncing in there with shouts and giggles of pleasure. (Just make sure you read the directions to make sure your baby is clipped in at the right height to get the right amount of bouncing and don't hurt their little feet or knees).  I highly recommend this product to any new parents who need a break from carrying their baby for a while.,X_test
6867,"I bought this for my 6.5 month old. But it was too small and did not seem comfortable.  It was hard to adjust the straps.

Free return shipping and full refund.",X_test

6869,"Just received my first order today.  I purchased lots of different styles of this company's products and will review each one as I try them.  Well packaged and delivered, 2 packs had lost their vacuum.  Was given 2 different samples to try and will review those as well when I taste them.  I consider myself somewhat of an unofficial jerky connoisseur, even making my own jerky in the past.  I like the meat to shine through the taste, not sugar or salt.  A vegetarian I am not!<br /><br />Tasted my first pepperoni mild short shot today.  Upon the first bite I noticed it didn't have squishy fat oozing out of it like I remember these types of beef sticks having years ago when I ate them as a kid.  It had a mild pepperoni taste, not hot, not spicy.  Was that a slight hint of vinegar behind the nuance of flavor?  Had a nice, firm mouth-feel and a slight 'snap' around the edges when bitten into.  Wasn't hit with any sweet, and it certainly wasn't over salted.  Over-all, I rate this product high on the beef stick scale.  These weren't dried out, they were supple.  As a treat, I gave my dog a couple inches of it.  When his face came up to my hand and his nose hit the beef-stick, his eyes sort of rolled back in his head, Ha! To say the least, he loved it too!<br /><br />I have put all the packs of beef into my big freezer so they stay fresh and hold their integrity, since I bought over 150.00 worth (free shipping with 125.00 or more, at this time!)  I started a low carb diet and these are the perfect snack item to have on hand.  The beef is USA grown!  I would reorder these mild pepperoni short sticks again.",X_test

6873,"We originally purchased a Graco Snugfit 35 but upgraded to this car seat when the buckles on the Graco started cutting into our baby's thighs (at only 4 months!). You can tell a huge difference in quality between this model and the Graco - the Maxi Cosi padding and fabric are much nicer and the canopy is more generous. The crotch strap is longer and better placed so our baby is much more comfortable. It's also noticeably lighter, and easy to attach to our stroller (UPPAbaby Vista).<br /><br />Love it and wish we had purchased this from the beginning!",X_test

I even asked my doctor about this product and she told me to not to waste my time and how dangerous it is since it is loud.

Remember those old diskmen that skipped constantly because they didn't have internal baffling?  This is just like that.  I even followed the protocol for cleaning unit #2(per the company's instructions) before giving up on it.  The cleaning made no difference with the skipping.

6930,"Prior to ordering these on Amazon, I had purchased a smaller, more expensive, pack of Haribo Gummi Bears from a nearby Target. Upon trying them, I was immediately hooked on the taste, these Gummi Bears having a much more flavorful experience compared to other generic brands. Thus, I came across this 5-pound bag, and based on my previous encounter with the brand, immediately made the purchase. The item arrived in a timely manner and was simply the bag of Gummi Bears, depicted in the stock picture, enclosed in a box. The taste was what I remembered, yet the size of each bear was slightly bigger than the ones I purchased at Target, which I personally have no complaints over. The only problem I had was that the Gummi Bears I received weren't the freshest, being a little hard to chew in contrast to their jelly-like appearance. During the first few days I snacked on these, they caused my jaw to undergo some pain, making it difficult to chew while eating, whether it be these bears or other food. However, due to my stubbornness, I continued to eat these delectable treats and the pain eventually went away.<br />In conclusion, these Gummi Bears taste great and are a bargain for the price listed here. My only complaint is that they're a little tough to chew. I'm not sure if it's the specific product I received, but this is my general opinion for the time being.",X_test

6942,"I used a boppy with the first two, and now I'm using My Brest Friend with my 6 week old son. It's much better than the boppy. The boppy never seemed to be in the right place for support. I would end up using several pillows around the boppy to support myself. The back support of My Brest Friend and the adjustable strap make it totally comfortable. As a mom of two preschoolers as well as a newborn, I sometimes have to get up and walk around while he's nursing, and it's great that the pillow stays in place instead of dropping to the floor. It also makes for more comfortable nursing in the hospital (when you have to nurse on a hospital bed) and in the car (when you don't have any other pillows around you).<br /><br />My only complaints are that the silent release buckle isn't always silent, unless you press it just right -- I guess I haven't learned the trick of it yet. Also, the cover is not as easy to wash and put back on as the boppy. I still sometimes use an extra pillow underneath the side I'm nursing on for extra support, but it's not as needed as it was with the boppy.",X_test

6950,"I have very mixed feelings about this car seat.  Some parts of it work well and other things about it are annoying so here's the list:<br /><br />The Good:<br />- Price:  I think everyone has established this point.  For $39 you can't get anything else and honestly, if you're really strapped for money and that is your primary concern my recommendation is to just buy the seat and not read on because for the price it really is good enough and it meets all the safety requirements.<br />- Durable Cover:  I've washed this thing endless times, it's a poly material that seems to wash very well and still look decent.  Once it's out of the washer it's also practically dry so just air drying overnight or a quick tumble and you're good to go.  Not getting it back on is a different story ... read below under The Bad.<br />- Size and Weight:  It's very lightweight, I think the lightest on the market which makes it easy to transport although it has no place to hold while moving it so it's awkward.  As well, it's narrow so I'm fairly confident that you can fit 3 of them in the back of most cars.<br />- No Clunky/Clear View:  Due to lack of cushioning this seat provides ample view for your child to look out the window, perfect for curious toddlers.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- Incompatibility:  This seat in the top brands so it's not going to be compatible with a lot of other things so check to see what you really need this for.  If it's just going in the car and never moving, then you should be okay.  My biggest peeve right now is that I recently found out it's not compatible with the GoGo Baby Travelmate which is a great asset while traveling with your car seat.  So even though it's lightweight enough for travel, it doesn't sit with a travelmate so you can wheel it and your baby all around the airport.  HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!<br />- Messy:  It seems like there wasn't a lot of thought that went into this car seat.  The various clasp systems are in the back.  I made the mistake of pulling it out once to try to use them and you can never get them neatly tied up again so you have a bunch of buckles and stuff hanging behind it.  This really bothers me.  Also makes it hard to travel with when all these things are hanging off of it.<br />- Poor Base:  The base is poorly designed and can really cause some damage to your leather, especially with a heavier child.  I bought a mat from Amazon to go under it to protect my seats and still my daughter is 22 lbs and when I take the seat of sometimes I can see that the base has made grooves in my leather.<br />- Difficult to Clean:  Okay, make sure you don't take the cover off for a quick wash.  You pretty much have to reassemble the whole seat back together after washing the cover.  The simplicity of the latches are cool, I'll give it that, but simplicity doesn't always mean ease.<br />- No Neck Support:  I don't mind the lack of cushioning so I won't put it as a con and my daughter seems okay with that aspect as well, but there's absolutely no neck support here so if she ever falls asleep in it her head is all over the place and she really doesn't look comfy.<br /><br />So a 3-star rating is very adequate as it really is just OK.  I've been putting up with it because I don't want to buy another car seat and then have this sitting on my hands but now that I know it doesn't fit the travelmate I'm forced to buy another car seat making me wonder why I put up with this for so long.an never get them neatly tied up again so you have a bunch of buckles and stuff hanging behind it.

6951,"I've tried about six brands of protein bars. Most of these were awful. I think the higher protein content is what causes the nasty flavor. However, though there was the presence of that nasty protein taste, it wasn't as strong. The outer coating, as well as the strawberry flavor are two of the good flavors. I actually enjoyed eating it and could have eaten another. I had energy and wasn't hungry for awhile. I had heard that pasta was an energy food. But this protein bar performed better than a couple servings of mac & cheese, which had me hungry an hour or two afterwards. I think I paid $1 for a single bar at a local grocer.",X_test

6961,"This swing has been a staple of our nighttime ritual for the past five weeks (since little one was a week old), but the past week has seen it die a slow death. At first, it was just the noise (a loud \\""clack-clack\\"" as it swung back and forth), but tonight it finally bombed out completely. Not only is the \\""clack-clack\\"" so loud I can hear it in another room, but the swing is barely moving at all. Mostly, it's just sitting there grinding out loud noises. Back it goes. I'll have to find a replacement for it QUICKLY! :-(    Here's what I would say about it *if it were working*:    WHAT WE LOVE -     The two position chair - right now we use it in more of a \\""cradle\\"" position, but it can be adjusted to a more upright position when he is older.    The two swinging choices (back-to-front or side-to-side). He definitely likes side-to-side more for sleeping.    WHAT WE LIKE -     The music and \\""nature sounds\\"" - both are decent. Nothing fancy, but at least it doesn't sound like a tinny music box. I wish there was more of a \\""white noise\\"" option - the nature sounds work just okay for white noise - there are some louder nature sounds that punctuate the soundtrack every now and again and can be startling.    The swing is quite vigorous when empty. Once you put a kiddo in it, however, the \\""six swing speeds\\"" really produce about the same amount of swinging (full power a little more, minimum power a little less). Not bad, but not as much variety as one might hope. And our kid is only nine pounds right now - I wonder how much less swinging a 18 pound baby might get...    WHAT WE DON'T LIKE -   (apart from it's complete failure within a month or so of set up)    The padding on the chair is a bit thin. I ended up using the fluffy support \\""pillow\\"" we had gotten little guy for his car seat in the swing to keep him comfortable. Probably not as much of a problem for bigger babies, but for those under three or four months, it's a little spartan...    The safety straps are really long. Totallyineffective for a little one (though also not important for little ones, given their lack of mobility), but sometimes it's hard to get them out of the way while putting the baby in. Don't want him having to sit with a big plastic buckle jammed in his heiny...    Will probably get a more \\""plush\\"" swing the next time around given that we now know how much he loves swings!",X_test
6962,The product is great - I like a one teaspoon serving for my drinks and this tablet is much easier than trying to do a half of one of those 2 teaspoon packets.

6963,"These are okay, but I wasn't crazy about the container.  They seemed to absorb some of the taste of the container, which I found very off-putting.  Also, I wish they'd use real sugar instead of cheap substitutes.  There's really no excuse to use that junk anymore.  I'd gladly pay a few extra cents a serving or whatever for the real thing.  They use substandard ingredients, and it's not as good of a value.

6967,"I picked this up at a local supermarket today after recently watching an advertisement on TV. Man, they got me good. Once you flip the top, it has one of those \\""no mess\\"" type nozzles that squirts out only as long as pressure is applied to the bottle. Kinda neato. In terms of the actual taste and flavor, I used 8oz of water and initially, one half-second squirt of Mio Liquid Berry Pomegranate flavoring. I stirred it for a bit, and after much heart-wrenching anticipation, I was...not overly impressed. The initial resembling taste that I could recall would closely mimic that of Propel Water. It has a similar after taste after smacking the lips and tongue a bit.     I found that if you really want it to be flavored water and not water with a hint of flavor, you have to use much longer squirts. I tried a one-second squirt, and my water tasted much better. I could really taste the berry and pomegranate flavoring, but not impressive enough to have a second glass. It advertises 24 servings per bottle, but I can't imagine what little flavor you will be tasting if you really tried to stretch it to 24 servings. In my case, maybe more like 10-12.     My dealbreaker with this is that it provides no nutritional supplementation (i.e., antioxidants, vitamins, electrolytes, etc.), such as Propel, Vitamin Water, etc. So it really does just enhance the flavor of water. Seriously? I never thought water tasted that bad to begin with. But for mutants that have a hard time knocking back their non-flavored daily H20, this might do the trick. It's kind of cool to try out of novelty, and it definitely doesn't taste bad (they also have a plethora of yummy-delicious sounding flavors). But other than that, I can't imagine this being a household item. This is definitely not as cool as the bad boy putting is his pocket carrying with him around, as the commercial depicted. But one day if this does have nutritional supplementation, then watch out, because it's gonna be epic.",X_test

The quality of the backpack (material & design) is seen and felt from the first moment it was taken out of the the package. The picture holder is something we didn't even realize we needed until this backpack arrived. The parent section is very convenient. The insulated bottle compartment works perfectly in 85 degree San Diego weather for at least 4 hours without an icepack. The design of the compartments when loaded allows for even weight distribution which makes it very nice to use when trekking through the zoo with an 18 month old. The compliments from everyone never cease. I'm just glad there was only one on Amazon. I would have spent $200.00 on this bag. It's well worth it so far.

I don't , not like them but I just wish they had more \\""sweet spicy\\"" flavor instead of more sweet. The package I got was a bit old I think as it was a bit dry but not inedible. Don't get me wrong, I love jerky but these could be better and maybe fresher. My only real complaint other than it's dryness is it just isn't spicy enough to be called spicy. I love peppered/spicy jerky and this really doesn't fully cut the mustard.",X_test
7036,"As I anticipated, the caramels were excellent as always. I was, however, disappointed in the packaging by Going to the Sun Gifts. The red gift box that the three lbs. of sea salt caramels were packed in looked like it had been used and/shipped several times as it was crumpled and torn in several spots and was certainly not appropriate for gift-giving. The free 24bag of assorted caramels was torn with several of the caramels lying loose in the bottom of the packaging box. All of this was despite the packaging box being in remarkably good shape. I can only imagine the items were packed as we found them and the damage was not done during shipping. I doubt I will buy from this vendor again.",X_test
7037,"We got this for our baby's room, which is about 50-60 ft away from our bedroom, measuring straight through the walls.  It works very well, and will even pick up the soft lullaby music we play at bedtime.  The greatest part is that there is no white noise or static with this one.  When it's quiet in the baby's room, I frequently have to check the monitor to make sure it's still on because there aren't any cracks and pops like with some of the other baby monitors we've used.<br /><br />We keep both units plugged in all the time, so I can't comment on the battery life.

It is quite firm and as is the case with most albacore that is packed in water, it is somewhat dry, but that makes it perfect for the addition of mayonnaise for tuna salad or in a tuna casserole.  The difference between this and other canned albacore is that this has tuna oil added to increase the omega-3 content.

The carrier base has levels built in so that you can properly install it into your car!  It also has a compartment in the middle that can store things that you may need quickly, and also keep the owners manual safe. <br /> <br />This stroller is SO easy to fold up, with just one hand and foot!

It's subtle and actually refreshing! Personally, I use the &#34;16.9 oz. H2O&#34; as a guide, not a prescription that MUST be followed. I simply add approximately 16.0-16.5 oz. H2O and it's just right. I love that I can keep track of whether or not I'm getting my MDR (minimum daily requirements) of H2O with these packets. As long as I drink at least 4/day, I'm good!

7084,"I'm only a little embarrassed to be writing a review titled 'love this diaper.'    I recently purchased several different cloth diaper options to decide which ones I would use to size-up my 3 month old who is too big for the littlest diapers that we still have. In addition to this diaper, I bought a Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap cover, a  Thirsties Duo diaper, a couple wool pants, some Osocozy prefolds a BumGenius 4.0 and a Fuzzibunz One size. We had used Fuzzibunz perfect size small, Thirsties fitteds and covers and Kissaluvs size 0 for the newborn to first couple months stage. I ultimately decided on the Thirsties Fab Fitteds and the BumGenius as well as some prefolds to keep cost down.     These diapers, right out of the package, are super soft. They have nice soft elastic in the back and an extra snap in front for overlapping (for the tiniest little babes) at the waist as well as an adjustable rise. What I didn't quite understand before purchasing, was that these diapers have a pocket (in addition to the cotton/micro fleece pad that's sewn in) with an opening in the front and the back. This allows you to put a doubler in there for night time/ heavy wetters. My 3 month old little guy (about 12.5 lbs and 24.5 inches--long and lean) wears these on the highest rise and the tightest waist setting (without using the overlapping snap). We have already seen some seriously heinous overnight diapers with these and yet, no leaks. As another reviewer stated, it's not even wet all the way through in the morning! This diaper, paired with the Thirsties Duo cover is a great little system. It's a little on the pricey side, though, so hopefully the two sizes will take us to potty training.    I do think, as some others have stated that these may run a bit small. I don't see them taking my little guy all the way to 18 lbs on the size 1. He generally grows out of the rise before the waist. I like them so well, though, that I'll size up early if need be.    As a side note, everything I'veever purchased from Thirsties comes in a compostable package and is made in the USA. I consider these to be great added benefits!    UPDATE 9/20/2011  My son is now 16 lbs and is just about totally out of the size 1. We bought a few size 2 a few weeks ago so that we could use them at night--at 15 lbs I could no longer add a doubler and still get the waist on the size 1 to fit snugly. The size 2 are quite large but we immediately started him at the middle rise setting rather than the lowest. We now use the size two with a Thirsties hemp insert and a size 2 Thirsties cover for nights. We rarely have a leak--that usually only happens if I don't have a clean Thirsties cover and have to use one of our back-up Flips covers. He now completely soaks through the diaper and yet no leaks! I still really like this diaper but I don't see it lasting us through potty training. We only have enough of these to use at night because they're so pricey. We still mostly use BumGenius and prefolds during the day.",X_test

7099,"This stroller is just what we needed.  It is fairly small as &#34;double strollers&#34; go.  Our kiddos are older but it's working fine for them.  We have a just-turned 5 year old and a 2.5 year old who is more like the size of a 3-4 year old, so they can be heavy when both on the stroller.  It did make some squeaking noises on one of the wheels the third and fourth time we used it, but the squeaking went away; I think the wheel was just adjusting to their heavy combined weight.  We are probably over the weight limit but the stroller has been fine.  The purple color is nice.<br /><br />I got the great idea from another review on here to get a bungee-style cargo net (usually for bicycles or motorcycles) and use it as a backrest/kind of hammock style net for the child in the back to sit facing forward.  It's sort of hard to explain and I haven't taken a picture of it yet, but basically you stretch the net between the two bars in the back.  The cargo net will usually have hooks that will easily hook onto the bars.  Then your kiddo in the back can sit facing forward and rest their back against the cargo net.  The only problem I have with this is, they have to put their feet into the basket under the stroller.  This is a bummer because my older kiddo tries to stand in the basket or put a lot of weight on it, and I don't think the basket will hold up to well if they do that too often.  Then if the basket breaks I would be hard pressed to find something that will work, and their feet would just be dangling (or in my kiddos case, maybe dragging on the ground) and you wouldn't have the basket anymore, which is a pretty roomy and nice basket.  In any case, we usually use it as it is meant to be used, and I'm planning to just hang onto the cargo net for taking trips to Disney or somewhere that both kids may need to take a nap in the stroller.<br /><br />Just a few other things I wanted to mention, the sun shade is nice and can be moved so it covers more of the front kiddo or back kiddo, but my kiddos just kept yanking it back and forth because they both wanted it, so I just removed it.  It is very easy to remove.  The table for the front seat is nice, but can be hard to remove because the &#34;buttons&#34; that you need to press to remove it are not easy to press and you sort of have to press both at the same time.  It's still nice and we use it often; definitely not a deal breaker.  Also, the footrest for the front seat is short; specifically the foot part.  It is not too short for her legs, but it's hard for her to keep her feet on it because it's less than half the length of her foot (kind of hard to explain).  This is also definitely not a deal breaker though, because I know my younger kiddo is older than most kids that would be riding in the front and she also has large feet for her age.",X_test

The sugar is made up of sugar crystals, it is not the refined granules we are all used to which I think will add a fun touch to the decorating process for the kids.  My kids have a strong reaction to regular dyes in colored sugar and other unaturally colored products, so I was very happy to discover this product.  India Tree also makes naturally colored food dyes which would be good for frostings and such.  We haven't tried it yet, but I am going to order that next.",X_test

Just cook and set it as the instructions suggest, then toss it with tidbits of brightly colored fruit that harmonizes nicely with almond.

It's probably some kind of almond or soy milk, and I'll be darned if I'm going to foot the bill on this one.  If the fine folks at Tasty want to fund this project, more power to them... but I'm a busy person and I really don't have the time or equipment to conduct this kind of research, so get off my back, will ya??

When the box arrived I opened it up to find it wasnt decaf and then when I went back to the order  I saw that you had then changed the picture to show the brown top package and not the green top package. I reordered the decaf which my husband drinks and now I am stuck with this coffee instead of a dark rich roast.I believe that if you would have shown this picture I would never have ordered this coffee.

I put the liner in the Bumgenius cloth diaper I had (the first time ever using both a cloth diaper and the liners) and expected it to absorb all the pee and the poop and simply give me something to flush in the toilet. I was sorely mistaken. My baby girl soaked right through this liner! It feels like a dryer sheet and is simply for cleaning up solids from baby's diaper. So, if your baby has soft poop or if you're looking for something that'll keep you from having to wash cloth diapers, this is NOT it.<br /><br />However, for what it is, it's a great product. I just don't understand how helpful this can really be for any baby who still has soft stools.",X_test

You have to put the phone up close to your ear to hear the music and there is no volume control.  The music on the phone stops very quick and you have to keep pushing the 1 button on the phone.

7130,"I originally bought this coconut oil at a health food store because they had some sort of promotional sale, and I moved soon after, so this big jar ended up in storage for more than a year.  I finally came across it when sorting through boxes, and assumed it would go in the discard pile.  I know how delicate some oils are, and rancid oil is especially bad for you.  So it was surprising that this jar was still as fresh as new - I later read that coconut is one of the most stable oils.<br /><br />At first it was a little alarming that the oil in the jar normally resembles something like shortening or the lard we had on the farm, or it can melt in the jar and be clear when the room temperature is higher in summer.  But I take it by the spoonful right out of the jar.  It is also good for cooking, like scrambled eggs and so on, I use it interchangeably with butter now.  I also really like it on my skin for moisturizing after a shower.<br /><br />I agree that I normally prefer a glass container for almost everything.  I am extremely sensitive to plastic fumes of any kind, partially because of medication I take.  I can't even drink from plastic \\""glasses\\"" because they smell funny, hard to explain especially when visiting. That being said, I detect no fumes from this packaging, maybe it is a special kind of plastic like that used for my blender jug.

I don't remember ever tasting a tea that I couldn't drink but I think this may be the one.  I opened three bottles thinking that perhaps I had just gotten a bad bottle, but the flavor was consistantly BAD.

7180,"This swing is my daughters favorite place in the whole world (apart perhaps from her Dad's arms!)... and it always has been.  Our daughter is now 4 months old, but we bought this swing when she was 5 weeks, and I must say this was the most worthwhile $130 I have EVER spent.  It is sooo comfortable and there is very little negative I can say about it.  Amy, our daughter was colicky up till 10 weeks, and although at times nothing would console her, this swing was always our best bet.  She just relaxes with the side-to-side movement... she much prefers this than front-to-back, but it is good to have the option.  The shape of the cradle means she feels secure and comfortable and the tunes are soft and relaxing.  She doesn't seem a big fan of the nature sounds, and yes, its true, all she sees of the overhead mobile are the l'il critters feet... but really the pros outweigh the cons - I attach Tiny Love toys from the mobile and that adds more interest.  It is true that the swing mechanism clunked and clicked a little more than I thought it would, but if anything Amy likes the rhythmic sound it makes, so it turns out to be a bonus!!. Before I bought this cradle swing, I borrowed a standard swing from a friend (I think it was Evenflo) swing and there is no comparison - the side-to-side movement seems much more soothing for newborns, and they can lie/sit in a much nicer position.  This is the Mercedes-Benz of swings and in my opinion worth every penny. Now that Amy is more interactive and likes to grasp at objects the toy bar is becoming another firm favorite... again it is easy to clip other toys and rattles onto the loops of the bar.

7188,"The couch sits 1 child comfortably. Two children is tight, but as long as the 2 kids don't mind touching slightly, it won't be a problem.    The construction is okay. For a small piece of furniture and the price, I would have expected something much more durable. My child hops on it and falls into it and he can feel the wood frame underneath the cushioning. The arm rests have no padding on the topside, so resting on the armrests hurts because the wood frame digs into kids.    If you've ever shopped for furniture at a discount place, then you know how they cut corners to make cheaper furniture. The manufacturer has cut all the corners for this piece. Some extra padding in the back, the armrests, and the seat would have made this a more durable product without adding to the cost. Actually, I probably wouldn't have noticed all the other shortcuts taken to manufacture this item if the armrests, at the least, were properly cushioned and did not hurt to lean on.    Item is cute and looks good, but only functional if your child will remain seated in an upright position. Laying on and horsing around does not got well with this item.    Couch could have also been a couple inches longer to better accomodate 2 children sitting.    Based on construction, I would have been willing to pay $[...] for this item, half of what I actually paid. I guess children's play furniture has high mark-ups, too.",X_test

7200,"I so wanted to love this stroller.  The 2 stars I gave went all to the compact folded size and the easy folding mechanism.  Bought it and kept it for 3 weeks, trying every way to make it work comfortably for my 9-month old, but at last we gave up and returned it.<br /><br />We were so in love with the easy close/open mechanism of this stroller.  No other stroller out on the market could compare to it.  Using one hand, you can easily close the stroller by just pulling up the bar at the bottom and to open, you just need to pull out the handle bar and the remaining of the stroller will follow.  And it's folded size is so compact that it's even smaller than my diaper bag.  The weight is also acceptable to be carried on shoulder, with the shoulder strap attached to the stroller.<br /><br />Maneuver is easy and smooth, even with the small wheels.  I don't expect much of the storage with this compact size of a stroller, so I have no complaint.  However, the one major problem that made us returned the stroller was the seat.<br /><br />I wouldn't have noticed the seat problem if I didn't put my own child on.  The seat, where the baby sits on, is too flat.  The seat pocket isn't deep enough to hold my baby's bottom securely.  Or you can say, there is no &#34;seat pocket&#34; at all.  The sitting area is flat and the back rest is made with a wrong angle to go with the flat seat.  So, my baby either kept slipping down and all slumped or had to sit herself up straight to make herself more comfortable.  Either way was a pain for her.  Slipping down and all slumped made all her weight gathered at the buckle.  It was only the bucket holding her whole body from slipping out of the stroller.  And sitting herself up straight all the time was worse, it created safety issues.  Her back would not touch the back rest and so her neck lacked support the whole time when I was pushing the stroller.  She couldn't stay in the stroller for more than 10 mins.  After 10 mins, she would either struggled to sit up or lie down with a more comfortable position.  I tried all the recline angles but none worked to make a comfortable seat.  My baby would start screaming after 15 mins if she was still buckled in the Yoyo.  :(<br /><br />We tried it out for 3 weeks, with different reclining positions and on different types of roads; We even did some modification to make the seat a better seat (like, trying to put a folded towel in the front of the seat near the food rest, so to make the seat pocket deeper), but still, nothing worked.  So we had no choice but to return it.<br /><br />We still like Yoyo a lot in terms of the compact size and the easy fold, and we would even be willing to keep it if my baby wasn't crying in it.  However, no luck, babies know what's best for their own comfort.<br /><br />Attached is the picture of my baby sitting in Yoyo.  The lower right bottom was her sitting in the most upright position of the stroller.  Her back couldn't rest on the back due to the wrong angle or the seat and the backrest and she had to sit up to make herself sit comfortably.  The upper right picture was her slipping down and all slumped.  I unbuckled her and wanted to pull her back up and tried sitting again, but then I remembered to take a picture first.  So she wasn't buckled up in the picture, but her position was exactly like this when she was buckled.  And she was sitting in a halfway reclined.ggled to sit up or lie down with a more comfortable position.  I tried all the recline angles but none worked to make a comfortable seat.

7214,"I have to drink decaf tea in the evenings and before I found this Typhoo I always had to trade off decent tasting tea for being able to sleep at night. But Typhoo decaf makes a very robust and flavorful pot of tea. On more than one occasion, somebody in the family has grabbed this decaf by mistake and nobody even realized it was decaf until we noticed the distinctive round bag in the bottom of the pot. This tea is best brewed by the pot using fully boiling water. If you try to make it by the individual cup using 190 degree water or water heated in a microwave, you'll probably be disappointed. Besides compromising the flavor, brewing by the cup would be wasteful since a single bag makes a good three cups of tea. The only compromise needed when brewing this decaf over regular black tea is the decaf needs to steep a bit longer (I'd say ten minutes) for maximum flavor. Alternatively, you can limit the water to two cups and then it's ready in about six minutes. Typhoo also makes regular caffeinated black tea which I consider to be just average.",X_test

I liked the idea of the adjustable leg elastic but the elastic wore out after about 10 months of use. My advise would be to consider the one-size diaper as more of a 2-size system (med/small) and buy both the 1-size and the sized mediums and you'd still be saving money because you wouldn't have to buy a full stash of smalls and a full stash of meds. The 1-size would serve as smalls but still fit into the \\""med\\"" size range and when your child got to 15lbs or so then buy how ever many size med you need to complete the stash and since the med run big you shouldn't have to buy the large size.

My old favorite is EfaGold, so I will compare a bit.  The Eva Gold from Nature's Way has a stronger aroma upon opening, but is somewhat harder in consistency and not as easily spreadable off the bat as the Viva.  The Viva didn't have a strong aroma of coconut oil upon opening (I know that some people don't like the stronger aromas, but I do), but once I cut into it, I could definitely smell a very light and pleasing scent.  I actually put it into my teas in the morning time and like the taste of coconut oil mixed with my herbal teas.  I know this is gross to some, but for me, it's heavenly.  I also use this for my skin, hair, and cooking. I believe that coconut oil has controlled my appetite, smoothed my skin, and allowed me to loose some weight.  Time will only tell if it will meet all of my needs, but I wanted to point out the lighter less heavier coconut taste and smell, and also the creamier spreadability as I know from reading other reviews that there are many differences in opinions.

So the only reason I'm giving this a 4 and not a 5 is because I like a super strong coconut taste and smell.  Otherwise, it's great!  Shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition. Hope this review helps somebody.",X_test

7258,Please note that only about 50% of these actually stuck to the wall. I have gloss wall in my sons room and this kit requires you to sand the wall first. I did sand for the first one.... needless to say there is now a large unglossed portion of the wall that looks horrible!! For the amount I spent on these I expected better results. Also please note that if you screw up on the rather complicated application process there is no removing them and these are very easy to tear when applying the to the wall leaving a half cloud and a rather fustrated consumer to say the least. Thank goodness my son wasnt home when I applied them for there would have been a few new words he would have learned that night.,X_test

This is outrageous for a product that sells (in Canada) for 80$. Not only that I have been inconvenienced with a defective item, but I am asked now to pay more money to have it fixed.     Cons:  - the battery does not last more than two hours  - the volume is very low even at the max setting, you can not hear the baby unless you keep the monitor very close to you.   -VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE - I will never purchase a Motorola item again after this experience    Pros  -None    Don't waste your money on this monitor, there are so many other options out there!!!",X_test

I prefer to drink my tea after steeping for 2-3 minutes (don't like it overly strong myself) and find I can usually get a decent second cup from 1 tea bag.

7349,"After trying, and loving, the Sweet and Spicy flavor, I thought I'd expand my horizons and try some other Good Earth teas.  While I can't claim that I love them every bit as much, they're still excellent teas and well worth the time to try.    What isn't immediately apparent from the description (and requires a close look at the box) is that the teas are flavored.  In my case, I was really pleased with the added flavorings.  The black tea flavored with tropical peach was my favorite, but I also enjoyed the white tea with vanilla.  Chai is always a welcome addition, too, though there wasn't anything spectacular about the Good Earth version.  The green tea was enjoyable, but not memorable.    The one thing that disappointed me was the number of decaf teas that were included.  Because the decaf green and decaf chai count as 'flavors', you get a lot less of the best flavors (the black/peach and the white/vanilla teas). I'd prefer it if there was a separate variety pack for decaf teas, rather than mixing them all together.      All in all, though, I enjoyed this variety pack and I'd buy it again, though I think next time I'd just go for an order of either the black tea or the white tea instead.",X_test

Anyhow, I saw this in a discount bin at the supermarket for a buck and decided to try it, since it fit the bill: Green tea and decaf, plus it sounded healthful, didn't expect it to taste good.<br /><br />It tastes so good, and I really like the deep red/purple color as it's steeping, that it's been calling me even when not sick, and now I'm buying a box of six for way more than a buck a box, but decided it's worth it. Delicious, drawing me away from coffee with all the half and half and sugar I add to coffee, and feeling good when I drink it.<br /><br />Sorry if this sounds like a sales pitch, but I like it enough to hop on and review it, so that says something... and I'm sipping it while writing this :)",X_test
7354,"I don't bake or cook with chestnuts; if I did, any old brand would do, I suppose.  BUT, when it comes to finding a great-tasting roasted chestnut to snack on right out of the bag, these are the bomb.  As a kid, my relatives up north always shipped raw chestnuts down to our house for the holidays.  Dad taught me how to cut a slit in the shell, then bake them in the oven, and then carefully peel off the shells (torture).  Loved the smell and the taste.  I have tried the Galil brand and the Gefen brand from Amazon.  The Galil wins hands down--they are moister, fresher, and better tasting. Sometimes,  I empty the bag onto a paper towel so it can absorb some of the excess moisture that has collected on the outsides of the chestnuts (they are not slimy or greasy, as some readers have commented). While none of the roasted and peeled chestnuts look very appetizing, they are certainly delicious.  And I do not miss the tedious cutting, cooking, and peeling that I had to do&#34; in the old days&#34; before I could enjoy them.",X_test
7355,"I grew up in a town North of Chicago with a large Jewish population. Halvah was a treat that we had in our house all the time, the only place you could buy it was the deli.  It came in 2 flavors: plain and marbled (chocolate like).  You bought it by the ounce from the deli guy who would cut it off the block of halvah.  When delis stopped carrying it, we were able to find  the chocolate covered sold in pharmacies and local small markets.  Fast forward 30 years, had moved to Northern California and not had halvah in years.  Then I see it at Real Foods.  The first bar I bought was stale so my opinion was it wasn't the halvah I knew.  I bought a bar a while later, hopefull and to give it another chance--that bar was less stale.  I advised the buyer at Real Foods about it being stale.  I bought a bar again recently and it was fresh and delicious, exactly the way it should taste and the right texture (texture is important)<br /><br />The texture and taste is something people who know halvah can appreciate.  I treat myself to one of there bars whenever I shop at Real Foods but not more than once a month  It's strictly a treat because it's very high in fat and calories.<br /><br />I give this bar 5 stars, as long as the bars are fresh.

7356,"I loved Fog Chaser when I first found it and even subscribed for monthly delivery. It was shortly afterwards though that I noticed my Keurig machine was brewing full cups extremely slowly - it was taking twice as long to brew a cup. So I did all the cleaning and maintenance suggestions found on You Tube - whatever could be taken apart and cleaned, was, yet there was minimal improvement. I was thinking my Keurig brewer had seen it's better days and needed to be replaced soon.<br /><br />Then came Christmas and I ordered a few new coffees I wanted to try and much to my shock, when loaded with new std plastic k-cups, the machine brewed faster than I've ever seen.<br /><br />What happened? - Fog Chasers have a unique cloth/mesh bottom and the brewed coffee isn't forced out of the bottom pierced hole when the handle is pushed down to brew. This results in more of a drip effect which aside from being slow, has coffee spraying out causing a mess instead of creating a steady stream!<br /><br />So as much as I like the taste, I've given up Fog Chaser because I can't deal with the slow brewing speed and spraying mess.

7359,"I love brewing loose leaf tea, except for the bits of tea leaves that inevitably end up in the bottom of my tea cup!  I have bought so many tea infusers hoping to find one that keeps the sediment to a minimum.  I might have found that with the TeaSpot Tuffy Steeper.  This is such a great idea!  I love the fact that you can collapse it to make it easier to carry with you.  It comes with a lid to cover the infuser while the tea is steeping, keeping the tea nice and hot.  The holes in the infuser are so small!  If you use a good quality loose leaf tea, I don't think you will have any problem with bits of tea leaves getting through.  The little handle on top is kind of odd.  I am not sure why it doesn't go the other way but you can use it to pick the infuser up out of the tea when you are done brewing.  It does displace a lot of water, so fill your cup up as much as you can while the infuser is in the cup.  The shape does allow the tea leaves to open up during the steeping process which gives you a great cup of tea.  Love it! Will use it all the time!",X_test

7375,"This review is for the strawberry flavor, in case the listings ever merge.  (It'll be pretty similar to my review for the raspberry flavor because they're pretty similar.)<br /><br />First off, be careful when you open the package.  These are little tiny pieces, maybe around the size of green peas (but cubic in shape).<br /><br />I like these.  They're a little bit like gummy candy although softer (they're vegan, though).  They're pretty addictive.  The strawberry flavor and scent are prominent.  These have a lot of fiber (6g in a 1.4 ounce serving), a lot of vitamin C, no sodium, and very little fat.  Here is the ingredients list since I didn't see it on the product page:<br /><br />Strawberry, plum, apple puree, apple juice concentrate, organic baobab fruit pulp, black carrot juice concentrate, citrus pectin, natural flavor, rice flour and vegetable oil as a coating agent.<br /><br />Sugars are kind of high, but they're natural fruit sugars and not added.  These are much more interesting as a vitamin C supplement than a lozenge and are flavored strongly enough that you'd be able to taste them, even with a cold.  These are also a more healthful alternative than &#34;fruit&#34; snacks with artificial colors and added sugars.<br /><br />Harvesting the baobab provides sustainable income for women in southern Africa (according to the package) and 10% of profits are donated to a foundation run by the manufacturer that supports sustainability and fair trade of the baobab tree (among other goals).",X_test

7391,"Saw this as I was perusing a local pharmacy for a decent light lunch. I was about to settle for one of those cold cut and crackers deals when I saw this and snatched it up. It was perfect. A nice light healthy lunch power packed with protein. It came with sesame crackers (very tasty), humus, a very tasty fruit and nut mix, roasted edamame and a small square of dark chocolate. The great thing about this product is there is not alot of sugar (the chocolate is sweetened with beet sugar), NO MSG (which is a big reason I love this product!), and the fruit and edamame really is tastier than you will find in other mixes. My only complaint is that there should be more crackers...:  Still, I am loading up on these and they're gonna be my main lunch for the next few months :)<br /><br />I would like to add that there have been a few negative comments about how hot and spicy the nut mix is. I eat alot of hot spicy foods. I like the spicy nut mix and didn't think it was all that hot and spicy. Perhaps, at first there's like a burst of spice flavor... but any heat dissipates quickly. If you have never eaten jalapenos, chile, or turmeric, you might find it has too much bite for you. The kind of heat that is in the mix may bother some... in this case, eat just a few at a time along with your humus crackers. If you gobble the whole bag down at once, this may be a problem if you can't handle heat. The humus will help dampen the heat ;)<br /><br />LATE NOTE (09/2013) - I am glad to see that Go Picnic has rotated some of their side snacks. What this means is that you may not actually get the exact snack that is listed. For instance you may think that you are going to get a chocolate wafer, but instead they substituted chocolate almonds. I was getting a bit bored with the \\""same ol' same ol'\\"" thing and am glad to see that they change them around every once in awhile. It is stated on the box that the actual side snack may differ.

When it comes to the beverages I enjoy everyday, my morning coffee let the pack. I was addicted to those flavored coffee creamers that are delicious, but contain many things bad for the human body.<br /><br />This chocolate-raspberry liquid is delicious, and like all new food changes, did take some time for my taste buds to enjoy fully. Sugar is extremely sweet. My taste buds were used to that level of sweetness. So when I switched to this stevia liquid, at first, the subtle flavoring levels were not apparent. I use about a dropper full in every cup of coffee, although the instructions suggest a few drops. I may decrease the amount in the future, but for now, that amount satisfies my taste buds.<br /><br />Now that I've been using for about a month, I appreciate the delicious flavors, and have subscribed to auto-ship every month.

Their Earl Grey is pretty good for the price, as are some of their other selections, but this blend is utterly weak. I made a cup (a fairly large mug, but still) using THREE tea bags and only then did it get any sort of appreciable flavor. In comparison, I only use two bags of Earl Grey when using this same cup and the flavor is much more developed.<br /><br />Maybe rooibos just isn't for me, or maybe this blend is just too mild. Either way, if you prefer strong tea, I would seek elsewhere. If you want a strong, spicy tea, I would suggest trying Harney & Sons' hot cinnamon spice.

Just big enough for Yor keys, phone, and some cash/cards! My only complaint is that it's smaller than I was hoping. It's a big bag for the brand, and as a mother of twins still in diapers and taking bottles I was hoping for it to fit our overall needs better. But, I would definitely recommend this bag for a parent with only one baby, and it's a great alternative for me for when I know we will be out for just a short trip (that way I can leave our monster of a diaper bag at home unless were going out for several hours)! Another great feature is the gripping stroller clips... Much better quality than the others that have come with my diaper bags with MUCH higher price tags :)",X_test

It has a good amount of  removable toys hanging from it and an attached mirror in one corner.  Also 3 flowers on the mat that light up when the music is turned on.  Things I like about it are that the toys are of good quality as well as cute and the mat is nicely padded.  It also has a few different interesting features such as a crinkely elephant ear, furry zebra mane, squeaky bird, etc.. which are on the mat itself.  I also like that you can detach the toys to wash or take with you.  My son loves chewing on them.  The colors and patterns of this mat are very nice.  Visually stimulating for the baby yet not gaudy. Very cute and fun.  And the music isn't annoying as on some toys.  The tune can be changed and the sound quality is good.  I found the price of this was a bit high, but when compared to some of the other ones, the little bit extra that you pay is worth it.  I have another one someone gave me and I don't like it half as much simply because it's lacking a lot of the features this one has. The only thing I don't like is the mirror seems a bit warped when you look into it, so I'm guessing the baby doesn't see himself all that well in it.

Plastic boxy ones are smaller, even though not as high quality.<br /><br />Assembling the jumper was hard for me.  The three springs that attach the jumper to the metal supports are permanently attached to the metal supports.  To assemble, you assemble the  rounded triangle base, then attach the poles that hold up the jumper.  But you must attach them while they are connected to the jumper.  It was confusing for me, because for the first pole, I had to deal with jumper and two other poles being awkward.  Then for second pole, more of the same.  Then for third pole, the jumper weighed it down.  This matters to me, because I'm removing the poles from the base frequently to store this, so it doesn't take up space.  (The actual attachment for poles is OK to assemble and unassemble.  To assemble, just snap in place.  To unassemble, push a button that allows the metal poles to disconnect.  What is hard about this is dealing with the parts that are already connected together.)<br /><br />The actual jumper looks fun with many activities for a baby.  It has monkey thing that dangles from above the child, a small mirror that is a bit like a fun house mirror but more like a real mirror than most children's toys, a wheel baby can spin to hide and expose different pictures of animals, a light up \\""waterfall\\"", beads that slide along a metal pole, etc.<br /><br />The other thing about this, and all jumpers, is anything that dangles a child from the crotch can be bad for hip development.  So, for babies under 6 months, especially, but then even older, this shouldn't be used for a long time.  If time is limited and it is used to give the child little activities to do, then that's good for baby to develop.<br /><br />Update:  My baby has enjoyed the bouncer from about 4 months old up to now 8 months.  He would only use it for short amounts of time (maybe 5 minutes) before he was about 6 months.  Now, he will happily bounce and hit things for 20 minutes at a time.  He can crawl, but he still likes the bouncer and does not see it as a containment device.  So, this has a pretty long useful life for a baby.  I also moved to a huge apartment with ample space for this bouncer.  I still think it is too big.  Baby Einstein has on that folds up for storage, and my baby's daycare has that one.  That other bouncer is sturdy, comparably priced, and stores easily.  If you are buying new, please look at fold up models, and only get this Rainforest Friends one if you have enough space for a refridgerator sized item in the nursery.  This and the refridgerator will take up similar amounts of space.",X_test

7423,I ordered this item and even paid for 2 day shipping after my 20 month old learned how to open knobs and handles even with those covers that are suppose to be childproof.  I thought I would try this after reading all the good reviews.  Unfortunately after only 3 days of use the pad that rests against the door frame tore and came apart rendering the item useless.

I used to love Tuno, but when it left the market I was on the search for an alternative.  I tried making my own using chickpeas, but being the lazy vegetarian that I am...it just didn't cut it.  When I saw this Fishless Tuna on Amazon I figured I'd take a leap of faith and buy a case.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised by the flavor and texture, quite appealing.  I prefer the 5oz cans as it's perfect for 2 regular sized sandwiches or 1 large roll (like a hoagie roll).  Generally I just mix mayo (Helman's only for me), spread it on bread with maybe 1 slice of cheese and eat.<br /><br />I do recommend this to lazy vegetarians like myself who want convenience in addition to not eating meat.",X_test

7451,"This Celtic inspired tea chest is simple but elegant. As soon as I saw it, I placed it on my wish list and was so happy when good friends bought it for me. The box is sturdy, and divided into quarters. Instead of the traditional paper packets, the tea bags are sealed in what feels like a paper/plastic blend but it also may just be a shiny effect that was added to the packets.<br />There are many Tazo flavors I haven't had the opportunity to try before, and they're so good! So many samplers have a number of \\""throwaways\\"" in terms of enjoyment, but so far every flavor is bright, strong (but not too strong) and comforting. I've been a fan of Awake black tea for some time, as well as Passion, which is a fruity hibiscus blend great for iced tea. New to me is the Wild Sweet Orange, which is as sweet and juicy flavored as it sounds. I'm currently enjoying a cup of the Green Ginger, which has a spicy-sweet aroma and a fruity, gingery flavor that is not too sweet.<br />The only caveats so far are that The Celtic knot appears to be a raised, gold-covered applique as opposed to being embossed, but as long as it isn't actively peeled off it doesn't look like it's going anywhere. Also, there is a chemical/lacquer smell that is evident in the box, but I don't find it has affected the tea at all. The dividers in the box would allow for it to be used to store more tea, or small items like jewelry. It's a great gift for a tea novice to a tea lover.",X_test
7452,"I did buy this product through Amazon but used an account/payment in my maiden name so it might not be verified. If you look at my history you will see that I am a legitimate frequent shopper. I did not buy this product as an infant. I was a new mom with a definite strong fear of SIDS. I did my homework about when SIDS becomes statistically less of a threat (about 6 months you are almost out of the woods and by about 2 the fear is just about over). At 2 I decided that the risk of me getting in a car accident with my child because of sleep deprivation outweighed the risk of SIDS.<br /><br />Because of the risk and new standards for infant sleep, mine did not. I did my best until we got him a \\""big kid bed\\"" and despite the unique Disney Cars design the bed was unslept in because it was not comfy. I read all the reviews about memory foam mattresses and decided to give the pad a try because the existing mattress was good and spending a great deal of money on a bed that would only last another year or two did not make sense.<br /><br />It has been about 6 months and while the mattress cover did not keep the monsters out of the closet it, it did ensure once my son was a sleep he stayed asleep because he was comfy. If he lies flat on the mattress he can breath out of both nostils just as well as on a standard mattress. It is a stuggle but even a standard crib mattress fits over both the pad and mattress.<br /><br />This was a great in between option for us, cheaper than a new questionable mattress and much cozier than the rock of a mattress from infant time. I did not smell anything chemical like when this product was removed from the package. I did cover this and the sheet with a water resistant cloth cover so the distance between any possible chemical residue and my child was two layers deep.",X_test

7461,"We are huge fans of MAM pacifiers after trying a few styles. We fell in love with them when our baby girl was about 1 month, and we have been buying exclusively MAM pacifiers ever since. We usually have 3 or 4 sets open at a time (one at home, one at my work, and one set in the diaper bag, and we throw each pacifier out after being used for 2 months.<br /><br />One of the things about the MAM pacifiers we liked are the super cute designs. They are subtle and not gawdy, which is nice when  you take a photo of your child you see the baby and not a GIANT pacifier.<br /><br />However, after 6 months, the designs are not quite as cute, which is a bummer. These soft silicone pacifiers however are very cute. Our baby has been teething since about 5 months old, and she uses the backside of the pacifier to scrape along her razer sharp tooth nubs. I was super excited to see this variation of the MAM pacifier, so I ordered them.<br /><br />Our baby loves these even more then the standard ones as the soft silicone sides are great for teething, she doesn't chew on the nipple part, only the sides, whereas her other pacifiers she chews on the nipple, which is nerve-wracking.<br /><br />A note on the design - the &#34;style may vary&#34; that I received has a giraffe image on it, which is not pictured in included photos. This was a bit of a bummer because my husband and I are not super huge giraffe fans, but it's still cute.<br /><br />Highly recommend for a teething baby over 6 months that still uses a pacifier (ours uses hers at bedtime and in her car seat on trips).",X_test

7463,"I looked online at reviews for many different soft structured carriers. I had tried the front carriers like baby bjorn but those are not useful once baby gets heavy, so for my 10 month old who weighs 20 pounds I wanted a back carrier.  I looked into Ergo also but because the Beco Gemini also does hip carry, front outward/inward carry, in addition to back carry so I chose the Gemini. I hadn't known anyone who had it but decided to buy and I think it was a a good choice. My 10 month old at first was nervous and fussy because he had never been in a back carrier. But after walking him around it a few times he now loves it, smiles, and is so comfortable that he falls alseep while in back carry mode.  I also have an infant and like the choice to have infant face inward in front carry (without infant insert like other carriers) and later have chance to do front facing out with my infant too. My 10 month old is very happy/comfortable in it, the gemini is lightweight but feels very sturdy and is easy to use, while sitting on a couch with baby behind you nestled in the carrier seat you can load your baby into back carry mode without anyone else's help. Ergo cannot do front facing out (but some people don't think that position is good because of excess stimulation) or front inward without infant insert, Gemini can do those and more. It seemed to have the most versatility and I like it so far, it's easier that carrying him in my arms for long periods of time. My back doesn't hurt at all.  My nanny also easily uses it to back carry and so does my spouse who are all different body shapes and heights. It's also very compact when rolled up and easy to take anywhere.",X_test

We spent all day yesterday and now all night just getting her to relax in it. She hated being strapped in and confined to one spot.

All. Night. Long. It's so frustrating because I want her to be safe in her bed, but she hates it so much. I tried giving her naps in it and for 12 hours yesterday it was a battle of getting her to calm down and sleep.<br /><br />So now we have to decide whether we try it again when she is older and can roll over or if we just wasted $100 because we can't live with the sleepless days and nights. :/",X_test

At first, I was thinking, no, these seem very much harder than what I remember, but it's very cold outside today, and the package was sitting on my doorstep for hours, so the candies were unusually hard.  Within about 20 seconds, the candy started to soften and I was able to chew it and move it around in my mouth.  My knees nearly buckled.

7491,"Let me start by saying that I was very hesitant about buying this playgym because of some of the negative reviews I read.  However, I really wanted some sort of playgym for my month-old daughter, and I wanted to see it in person before buying.  Our local Babies R Us only had two models in the store when I went there: this one and the Carter's Butterfly Play Gym.  Despite the glowing reviews I'd read about the Butterfly gym, when I saw it in person I was extremely unimpressed.  In my opinion, the colors were dull and nothing about the gym excited my interest.  The Discovering Water gym, however, immediately caught my eye with its vibrant colors and water-filled music box.  I decided to give it a try and figured I could always return it if either my daughter or I hated it.<br /><br />I have to say I'm DELIGHTED with this gym.  No, it's not perfect, but then again, what is?<br /><br />The first thing I really liked about this gym was that it's different than all the others I've seen.  Every other gym seems to have the same standard design: a flat floor mat (usually square) and two overhead arches that cross in the middle in an X shape.  The DW gym, however, has a rippled floor mat with flaps that can be lifted.  Each flap is shaped like a different sea creature (a fish, dolphin, whale, etc) and has a cartoon picture of that animal on top and a silkscreened photo of the real animal underneath along with the name of the animal in English, French and Spanish.  Even though my daughter is too young to actively lift the flaps to look underneath, at least they give her something to grab onto at floor level when she's lying on the mat.  As she gets older, she can do more actual playing with the flaps themselves.  I just feel that this gives the mat itself an extra layer of interactivity that's missing with the other activity gym mats out there.<br /><br />The standard X shaped overhead arches of other gyms form a square shape (four equal-sized spaces between where the arches meet the mat) and leave the gym wide open on all sides (which, I realize, some people might love).  The DW gym has two overhead arcs that come together in the middle and then bow out again rather than criss-crossing.  This makes more rectangular-shaped openings (two long sides and two short sides) than with other gyms.  What I really like about this design is that the arches themselves have a short length of netting (like a fisherman's net) hanging down from the top.  This combined with having one short end occupied by the water-filled music box really gives the gym a semi-enclosed feeling, like the inside of an undersea cave.  I think it makes for a wonderful spot for imaginative play, much more so than other activity gym designs I've seen.<br /><br />The gym itself can accommodate 12 hanging toys, although only 3 are included.  I think the selection of toys that are included isn't the best.  The plastic fish reminds me of a dog's squeaky toy, right down to the squeaker inside, but the high-contrast colors really seem to attract my daughter's attention.  The stuffed turtle is one of the Baby Einstein licensed characters - it's cute enough, but it doesn't \\""do\\"" anything, and when it hangs overhead the only thing to look at from below is its plain, undecorated stomach.  This is a toy best played with at eye level, unattached to the activity gym.  (I bought another, slightly larger stuffed turtle toy with a mirror in the stomach to hang overhead).  The third \\""toy\\"" is really a set of thick plastic flashcards with sea creatures and their names on them.  The pictures are very nice, but I don't really see how a young child would necessarily play with them except maybe to clink the plastic discs together (kind of like a set of plastic \\""baby keys\\""). I wound up purchasing 3 or 4 additional toys from a variety of companies to add to the gym - I object to having to spend the extra money when the gym itself cost so much, but all the activity gyms seem to be designed this way.<br/><br />The water-filled music box is a nice touch, and I like the fact that it has a motion-sensitive setting.  The baby needs to actually shake the arches (by pulling a toy) to activate the box in this mode, and I wish it were a bit more sensitive (it takes quite a bit of motion to set it off).<br /><br />I really like the pat mat in the floor of the gym.  This is basically a thick plastic bag filled with two-dimensional sea creatures and an ocean-looking background.  The instructions say to fill it with water and empty after each use, but I don't bother emptying and refilling it and we've had no problems.  Be warned, though - at first, it looks like you won't be able to fill it with water because the fill hole looks like one solid piece of plastic with a cover.  My husband and I actually thought we needed to poke a hole in the plastic in order to fill it.  Don't do this!  The fill holes are actually so very small you can't really see them - just put the sink faucet up to the fill hole and run the water in.  The mat fills pretty slowly but it does fill, and keeping the holes so tiny probably keeps the mat from leaking all over the place.  We haven't had any problems with leakage at all since getting the gym.<br /><br />I also like the crescent-shaped pillow that's included with the gym.  It's great for putting under your baby's head so she can look up at the hanging toys, and of course, it's perfect for \\""tummy time.\\""  The pat mat and liftable flaps on the mat of the gym give baby some interesting things to play with and look at at floor level during tummy time, too.<br /><br />On a side note, I took a Kick and Play Piano and tied it across the other \\""short\\"" side of the gym (opposite where the water-filled music box is) and it's worked out wonderfully.  This gives my daughter something to kick (she's a big kicker) plus when she does kick it, it moves the arches enough to activate the motion-sensor music box.  I can either leave the piano in the \\""off\\"" mode and use the music box activated by kicking, or I can leave the music box off and let my baby's kicks operate the music of the piano.<br /><br />The biggest disadvantage of this gym, in my opinion, is the price.  It's definitely the most expensive gym I've found, but in lots of cases (the Gymni and the original Baby Einstein, for example), it's only more expensive by about $10.  For all the \\""extras\\"" that this gym provides, I think the added expense is well worth it.s way. <br /> <br />The water-filled music box is a nice touch, and I like the fact that it has a motion-sensitive setting.

I would not use this on two-tracks or really uneven terrain because with 3 wheels, it could tip easily.  It has a 5 point harness system, which is nice.  I just clip toys and a pacifier on it.  Once you are comfortable with the stroller, you can pop it open with one hand!  I use this as an every day stroller.  I even use it for shopping - I just put my items in the basker under it.  You can't put a ton of stuff there, but $50 worth of groceries will fit.  This stroller turns on a dime, but you need to have the room to turn around since it is pretty long.

We were disappointed and considered sending it back.<br />However, after submitting a 3-star rating for the seller-feedback we were contacted swiftly by LOFTEK Customer Support. They suggested an app that does support Audio for iPhones and iPads (although it is a purchased app; not the FREE version). After downloading that app we have a great Audio/Visual Monitor for our baby's nursery. I suggested to the Customer Service Support that they make it clear in the product description that this app is necessary for audio use, and consider developing their own app or working with one already developed to provide free use to purchasers of LOFTEK cameras.<br />Now I am not disappointed in this purchase, but I did have my doubts that could have easily been avoided had the suggested app been made clear from the beginning.",X_test

7534,"*Edit* The price increase on prime services makes this no longer affordable, I have since switched to Taste Nirvana<br /><br />Ambrosia. I first learned this divine term in high school when reading Greek fiction. It is the term used to describe the drink of the gods, but the description stops there. Often I wondered what It might taste like for it to be so popular among deities. Does it just taste great? Is that all a god is looking for in their beverage? Or is it invigorating? I supposed it would have to be, after all, reigning over the realm of mortals and hurling thunderbolts must wear a guy/gal out. Would it need to be healthy and nourishing?The gods ARE Immortal, but that doesn't mean they can't get sick of overweight, just look at Dionysus for instance.<br /><br />I would ponder the potential attributes of such a drink for days, wonder what powerful, maybe magical, properties it would need to have to satisfy such a lofty audience. Then, one day long after I had given up my quest, I got my answer.<br /><br />As I was perusing the vast inventory of our local whole foods grocery store, I stumped upon something called C2o, the very product I am reviewing today. My thought process was \\""I love coconut, why not coconut water\\"" after all that reasoning had served me fairly well with other such substances (Lemonade, apple juice, ect....). My first taste was absolute shock, the drink was cold and smooth, it had a viscosity to it slightly greater than water, and a flavor that was mild yet distinct. Then the can was empty. I was distraught, so I turned back to the store to purchase another. The beverage has a subtle sweetness about it which is pleasant and not at all overpowering. It is as refreshing as a cold glass of water but with all the benefits of an one of those highly touted sports drinks. I was in hydration heaven...<br /><br />As I let the second can rattle to the floor, feeling a bit like a alcoholic, I realized I finally had my answer. THIS was ambrosia, this was what I had been trying to describe all those years ago. I needed more, but at 3.00$ a can I was looking at taking quite a hit in my wallet to feed this new addiction. So I turned to amazon and got a affordable solution. The cans were pretty banged up upon delivery but the C2o tasted none the worse for it.

7554,"I buy quality, more natural mac & cheese quite regularly and was a long time customer of Annie's products. Unfortunately I often found that glue and other contaminants (which spark when heated) made it into the finished products Annie's sells. I contacted the company about this and was ignored twice before receiving very brief a reply that there was no danger to the consumer. Call me skeptical but eating glue (it's probably from the sealant used on the box tops) caked to the pasta does not seem to me like a good idea, and I wasn't exactly thrilled with Annie's customer service, which was mostly dismissive (ignored my first two missives to them). There are plenty of great products and companies out there. I buy Back To Nature mac & cheese now, and actually prefer their spirals and elbows to Annie's shells as these also cook much faster than shells.  Furthermore, Back To Nature mac & cheese has the added benefit of employing vegetarian friendly enzymes in their cheese culture, as opposed to Annie's which does not uses animal enzymes. All in all there's no sense taking a chance on eating toxic substances when looking for a healthier alternative to the chemically heavy products from Kraft and the like.",X_test

7560,"[[VIDEOID:moVLZ2FEB071OS]]This video features JUST VEGGIES [from the Just Tomatoes brand of dried fruits and vegetables], showing the product \\""close up and personal.\\""  Included in this review are several other Amazon products which for me are related to the dried veggies [among them a couple food and health books on my KINDLE].  I've listed these below [with hyperlinks to Amazon product pages].<br /><br />It could probably go without saying that the dragonfly and ladybug shown in the video were not purchased from Amazon! They just happened to cross my path in such a way as to become video stars.<br /><br />The dragonfly was found lifeless but perfectly preserved.  Of course it did not \\""come with\\"" my Kindle, as my slip of the tongue in the video may have implied. The ladybug somehow found its way from my country kitchen onto the top of the container of JUST VEGGIES after I had broken the seal and opened the tub.  I didn't notice the  ladybug until I was showing the product in the video.<br /><br />According to my holistic doctor and my personal viewpoint [and studies of books by several medical professionals] the severe magnesium deficiency and soybean intolerance I unfortunately have is aggravated [if not caused] by food alterations and additives, especially soybean products.  Due to this, I've been forced into the dreaded and difficult task of searching for foods free of chemically synthesized or genetically altered intrusions.<br /><br />This painful and frightening situation has been blessedly eased by Amazon's variety of products suiting alternate tastes and needs. Some of these products are helping me slowly regain health and flavor in my life by working around what I've observed and read about an increasing preponderance of synthesized additives and soybean GMOs which are impregnating more and more foods in the marketplace... with some of them listed under insane misnomers like \\""natural flavors\\"" as discovered by people who have serious soy allergies [genetically modified organisms don't seem precisely natural to me].<br /><br />The cherished blessing in this forced change in shopping, cooking, and eating is that food I'm preparing now is beginning again to taste like JUST FOOD, making my stomach growl like it hasn't done for a few decades!<br /><br />As for my uses so far of the Just Veggies, it is a fantastic, flavor lush, light luxury snack.  It also tastes great reconstituted and warmed in the microwave with water, coconut oil, cooked diced potatoes, fresh cilantro, and chopped green onions.  I like Just Veggies best [the use seems most efficient] combined into a bowl of rice, quinoa, or noodles for added color, flavor, and nutritive value.  I'm attempting to stretch the dried veggies by thinking of them like Just Roasted Garlic, more as a spice instead of a main dish.<br /><br />Here's to natural flavor which comes from the food itself, or from spices or integrity enhancers added by an old fashioned cook,<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />Here's the promised list of books and products [regarding \\""Just Veggies\\""; I purchased the 4 oz 4 pk, but might try the 8 oz 2 pk size on this page next time] purchased on Amazon which are related directly or indirectly to this review:<br /><br />1.

7566,"I took a ton of time to decide on this seat. I am really happy with it. This is my second baby and since my son is now 8 we decided to get a new car seat. After reading a review from a mom whose husband crash tested cars and she highly recommended another Safety 1st Air Infant seat, plus going to 3 stores and comparing quality and comfort I decided on going with a Safety 1st seat. I decided on the Flutter version because of color and price. I was happy that the colors in person are more feminine than the picture. Our little baby girl fit in it comfortably and was nice and deep so there wasn't any head flopping. It also has little side bumpers for the head and her sides to hold her in place along with a pad under her body and legs. This seat also comes with the base which was not stated on the sale description. The base was very easy to install and extremely secure with the lap belt installation. Since my vehicle doesn't have the latch option I was concerned with how solid it would be. It can be used with the latch option too. There is a leveling feature on the base which goes by baby's weight and was very easy to use too. I am EXTREMELY happy with this seat, especially for the price.",X_test

It did shrink just a tad in the wash, but with the elastic straps, it still works just fine.  And one of my elastic straps did come off, but I just sewed it back on.  For me, the convenience has far outweighed these little incidences.  If they were a little less expensive, I would own many more!",X_test
7631,"We upgraded our single camera monitor recently because we are expecting another baby soon.  Unfortunately when we were buying our first one this monitor was way too expensive.  However, we just got a great deal on Cyber Monday purchasing this monitor for less than our old one (without the extra camera).    That being said, I LOVE this monitor.  Our previous monitor was a Lorex as well but this has improved many of it's flaws.    What I love:  1. The VOX function, many monitors didn't have this function and I love that I don't have to hear constant static in the background.  We have a sound machine running and it only comes on when my child is actually talking or crying.  I also love that you can adjust the sensitivity, I have a feeling we will be making it more sensitive when there is a newborn sleeping in the nursery.  2. Clear picture even in night mode my sleeping child is easy to see.  Big improvement from older model.  3. Two-way communication.  I kind of made fun of this one, but I have to say when I am moving my just turned two-year-old into a big bed in a month, I can see this being a great feature if he wonders out of bed.  4. Split-screen to view both cameras at the same time.  5. No bright LED lights on the hand held.  This was a big issue with the older model as well.  6. Light weight hand held.  7. Easy set up.  8. Knowing it is secure.  9. Absolutely no feedback from cell phones or other wireless devices!    What isn't so great:  1. It is hard to get the hand held just right into the cradle.  2. There is no way to set the hand held upright without cradle. However, I didn't love my last monitor's option either, I always felt like I was going to break it off and it wouldn't lay flat.  I think I would rather have this monitor that lays flat than one that can't stand unless you plug it in.  3. I think the camera function is kind of pointless.  I don't really know why you would want it but the camera isn't good enough for something like this anyway.      Why we stuck with a Lorex: We loved the VOX feature. Secure monitors. No cell phone feedback.",X_test
7632,"Great chia seeds at a great price. These come in a resealable plastic bag, although I dump it out and store them in Tupperware containers instead because they are easier to deal with (and less likely to spill).

I also use them to make my own version of an energy drink: a tablespoon of chia seeds mixed with half limeade (or lemonade if you prefer) and half water - delicious and refreshing, much better than Gatorade!",X_test

What we weren't expecting was the noise it made vibrating against the springs - as you put it under the mattress.  Also, after the 30 minutes or so when it's about to shut off, it goes into crazy too fast vibrate mode that woke our baby up EVERY time.  It was great if she was just falling asleep a little and we caught it before the shut off mode turned on.  We wish this product stayed on until we turned it off.<br />Again, the product is as described in the product description - I just had high hopes that it would actually work for my sleepless child!",X_test

7640,"Trying to stay away from all the GMO wheat, we've switched a lot of our recipes to spelt. This flour is ground much finer than the regular flour, so our first attempts turned out a bit more... flat? It seemed like the yeast was not strong enough to lift. So it's probably a good idea to use weight measurements (grams or the like) instead of cups.<br /><br />Since it's so much, I split it into zip-lock bags and put it all in the freeze.

7644,"I usually don't write reviews but I have been so disappointed and frustrated with this product that I felt compelled to.<br /><br />I know it's hard to find the perfect straw sippy cup that doesn't leak milk from the top of the straw but my son and I get sprayed with milk almost every time I flip the lid open.  Milk also leaks from the lid. Unless you make sure to twist the lid onto the cup properly (which I have also found hard to gauge), milk will leak down the side of the cup and get all over your floor, table, counter, baby, etc. I have also found the sippy cup sitting in a puddle of milk on my table/counter tops multiple times, but again, I think a lot of straw sippy cups are just like that.<br /><br />The weight at the bottom is a cool design concept but what's the point when you end up wasting just as much milk, if not more, from all of the leaking! For the price, I really do not think this product is worth it.",X_test
7645,"I use this product a lot, especially on grilled steaks.  I have learned to use it as part of a rub on my steaks.  I'll share what I do.    First I marinate the steaks for 30 minutes in a vacuum Foodsaver container, but a zip lock bag for 60-90 minutes would work.  (The vacuum opens the pores of the meat and lets the marinade better permeate the meat.)  Then I pat both sides dry and then add ground sea salt, ground black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and then I liberally sprinkle Emeril's Southwest Essence and then hand pat them all into the meat so they all adhere to the meat.  Then I turn the steaks and do it again.    My Weber gas grill will always get to at least 600 degrees, and in the summer in Phoenix I oftern get over 650 degrees.  With a clean grill I simply place the steaks and close the cover.  I grill my steaks based solely on time.  Depending on the thickness it will be anywhere from 3-5 minutes per side, usually 3-3.5 minutes.  I open the grill, flip the steaks and close the cover again.  The flip side is usually 30 seconds less than the first side and once the timer goes off I remover the steaks and let them rest.  If I am grilling asparagus I grill them now while the steaks are resting for a total time of +/- 4 minutes.      By the time I get back to the kitchen the steaks will be rested and will be medium rare.    Like I said, the Emeril's spice is perfect for us on this meal and since we do steaks at least once a week in summer, we use this product a lot.",X_test

I was not very good at getting used to the pain.  When I came home from the hospital, a friend of mine had this pump in her attic from her child.  So I borrowed it and purchased my own accessories.  It was amazing.  I could pump and watch TV, balance the checkbook or read a book.  Then, I could still give my daughter breast milk.  Anytime my breasts began to swell, I would just turn the pump on.  Since it is electric, it is a little noisey, but not that bad at all.

I love the concept, but this is just too inconvenient for real-life use. BTW, I am a very short, petite person and the extreme length of this material made it impossible for me to put it on without having the tail ends of it dragging all over the floor...plus there was a lot of material left over that needed to be knotted up to keep from having it hanging in the way.

The round metal part flips back so that the plastic teeth are separated and when closed they have a very firm grip on the fabric. The ribbon clip is hand washable, and the heartbeat gadget seems to be sealed well enough to not be damaged by getting wet.<br /><br />The heartbeat sound is exactly like what you hear from the ultrasound machine in the doctors office, so presumably it will be familiar to a newborn baby.<br /><br />The pacifier is newborn-sized with a natural shaped nipple.

7705,"I have eaten these since the 1970's.  Some people who write reviews are pretty wacko. The size of the can and contents has never changed: 3.25 Oz. The size of the herring fillets inside the cans vary, as wild caught fish vary in size and shape. They do not contain \\""fish on a diet\\"" as someone posted. A can may have 5 smaller fillets or one big one to make the can weight. I have NEVER broken the pull tab off. This brand is the only one which is really smoked (rather than \\""smoke juice added\\"").  Herring are a managed global fishery which is not over harvested/pressured. There are plenty of them. They eat algae, plankton and small stuff, so they do not accumulate toxins like carnivore tuna and swordfish do.  They are high in Omega 3 fatty acids. On a per pound basis, smoked salmon may be cheaper. Some people must think McDonalds only uses 4\\"" square nets so they can only catch fish the right size and shape for fish fillet sandwiches. And someone else uses smaller nets to catch the fish stick fish.<br />Postscript: Walmart sells these for $1.36 a can! I grabbed all that were on the shelf!",X_test
7706,"Recently I have become more and more choosy with my coffee. I own a Keurig one-cup brewer as well as a traditional coffee maker.<br />For years, I have been using the same coffee brand ( med or dark, middle-of-the road priced) and it was affordable and it tasted just fine. Lately, I was lacking depth and body when brewing in the keurig( I have the cup you can put your own coffee in, which saves resources and $). It seemed like I couldnt' pack enough flavor into the little chamber to really have the right strength. The pre-packed, ready to use K cups were much better, but at 3 cups/day for me not feasible in the long run.<br />I read the reviews of the San Francisco Bay coffee ( fog chaser) and the price appealed to me and also what customers had described, so I tried it. Besides the much more affordable price and far more \\""green\\"" packaging, I find the flavor fantastic!<br />Bold, yet sophisticated, not just strong- really pleasant flavor ! A very good choice at an attractive price!. These cups look different, but I like them much better with their filter-like body and 12-count bagging. Now I don't feel guilty when I indulge with more than 1 K cup. For loose coffee to put into the reusable cup I choose a def. dark roast like italian or french, which is very comparable to the Fog chaser's aroma.",X_test

7727,"I love popcorn. It's a fantastic and very flexible snack. I'm less a fan of microwave popcorn because I really can't tell what's in it, and it seems not only unhealthy but relatively expensive. Our household has been experimenting with different flavors for the past few years. Caramel corn is the easiest but sugary, and getting a cheese to stick to it is a bit of work. You really do need a powder, and something finer than the chunky shakeable parmesan so many of us put on our spaghetti. We have food allergies in the house as well, so we have to be careful with the ingredients.<br /><br />Enter &#34;Kernel Season's White Cheddar&#34;. I had high hopes to begin with - it meets our food allergies (gluten-free, no MSG), and it came in a large container (8.5 oz). The directions were a bit vague (sprinkle liberally), and I've still not found a &#34;sweet spot&#34; of how much to add. Sprinkling it by itself on hot popcorn isn't enough to get it to stick to the kernals, and you'll regret inhaling with a piece in your mouth (unless you like cheese powder in the back of your throat).<br /><br />This product does work very well if mixed with some melted butter, though, especially clarified butter (skim the fat off the top). We've been trying to keep the mix close to 1/4 cup popcorn (before air-popping in the microwave), 1 TBsp butter, 3 TBsp Kernal Season's seasoning. Works gorgeously, and the cheddar flavor goes so well with butter I suspect this would make a very tasty mac'n'cheese. I haven't tried it in a sauce yet but I should.<br /><br />Something that may seem small but is important to me is the container itself. It doesn't let the seasoning get messy. The lid is deep and seals tightly, and there's no fine grains of the powder spilling out into it when I take the lid off. That's important, especially considering how fine the product's texture is - I really did expect it to cake up around the pouring spout or get all over the place, and after three weeks (and probably a dozen batches of popcorn) it hasn't.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a tasty product that has many uses due to its fine consistency - again, it would work wonderfully in a sauce as well as a seasoning. I'm quite happy with it and wanting to try another variety.dozen batches of popcorn) it hasn't.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a tasty product that has many uses due to its fine consistency - again, it would work wonderfully in a sauce as well as a seasoning.

7739,"We've had all of the aforementioned problems.  Right off the bat one of the snaps holding the fabric sides to the armrests in the back broke.  No biggie- it wasn't sharp.  Our wheels turned in as well (like this / \) but we figured it was to make it easier to go over terrain like dirt and grass.  Nope- just a shoddily made product.  Our wheel fell off when we were at Disneyland (granted we did have the stroller for a year and a half, but we did notice the wheels at the store and asked about them- the sales person had NO idea why they were bent in like that).  Well, we called evenflo and they sent us a replacement rear assembly.  We put it on, but the wheels still turned in, although not as badly. It is now about 8 months later and the left wheel is about ready to fall off.  We are well under the combined 80 lb. weight limit so I don't know why we keep having this problem.  A few months ago the tray broke.  We did a quick fix with duct tape, then my husband was able to fix it (it wasn't easy- a screw on the inside fell out, but luckily he had a screwdriver extender that was small enough to fit).  I don't mind normal wear and tear (for exapmle, the black foam grip on the handle is torn, no big deal), but this is ridiculous.  So I will call and get yet ANOTHER replacement, which means I will be a week or more without my stroller.  Big pain.  I can't believe they are still selling this inferior product.  I like the stroller- it's not too heavy, folds fairly compactly, good sized storage basket, reasonably easy to maneuver, not ridiculously expensive, but with all the design flaws, I recommend another stroller.

7751,"DO NOT BUY THIS SOUP, PERIOD!  I live in the Annapolis, MD, area basically the middle of Maryland Blue Crab Country...and the Wye River Red Crab Soup is simply a disgrace.  This soup is merely a low end tomato vegetable soup.  What's concerning is that &#34;CRAB MEAT&#34; is listed as the 3rd ingredient, when in reality I really don't think there is ANY crab in it...probably only crab seasoning.  I purchased 6 cans, which are expensive, to feed our family of 6 thinking it would be a nice, quick, & easy meal that the kids will love (and we all love REAL Maryland Crab Soup).  The Wye River is located on the eastern shore of Maryland...so the total soup name is a scam.  To say we were disappointed is an understatement.  To make this matter even more troubling, is that there is a &#34;History of Wye River Crab Soup&#34; written by Joe Bernard, and apparently it's his family's long time recipe, which I read before purchasing (so I guess you can say Bernard reeled me in!).  Either Bernard's family is clueless on the basics of food or this old time recipe was altered significantly to feed the bottom line of their pockets.  Importantly, the management of Wye River Foods should be ashamed of themselves for actually making and selling this awful product.

That being said, I think that many protein powders that you mix with a tablespoon or two of peanut butter will be yummy and will freeze well.  I normally check labels when I buy food, but I didn't when I ordered Protein Freeze. When I saw what was in it I wasn't thrilled but most of the time I can have a little bit of artificial sweetener and not have discomfort. I was ok with Protein Freeze and didn't have any trouble digesting it.  When I ran out, I debated reordering, but it seemed like the shipping (on the website) was expensive for what I considered a so-so product.   I went to GNC instead and asked for the cleanest powder that they sold, and the sales woman showed me \\""About Time\\"", which doesn't have artificial sweeteners and had better nutritional numbers (lower in carbs and fats) than Protein Freeze.    I bought some and mixed in two tablespoons of peanutbutter with a scoop and a half of the powder and some water. It was AWESOME!  It's less awesome without the PB, but still drinkable  I didn't try to freeze the protein from GNC but I have a feeling it would be on-par or better than Protein Freeze.  So to sum up, I think Protein Freeze is good but not great... nothing special.  Additionally,  the whole idea of freezing or making a variety of things with protein powder isn't particularly original... just good marketing.

It's hands free so you don't spread any messes and the large opening makes it easy to get the dirty things inside.  I line it with a standard \\""medium\\"" size store-brand trash bag.  Actually I can fit more inside this diaper pail than in my more expensive \\""no odor\\"" pail.  This diaper pail would also work really well if you used it for your dirty cloth diapers (I use cloth diaper pails for that, though).  As for the stinky smell coming out when you open the lid, considering what's inside, I think that should be expected, but it's only while the lid is open.  Otherwise, when the lid is closed, it contains odors really well.  I would definitely buy this again and I recommend it to new mothers.",X_test

It's cheaper to go directly through the manufacturer (which is a rarity) - $8.99 per bag and 1 bag free with the purchase of 7.  The Bananas Foster doesn't let on to how good it is when you open the bag, but when brewed it is smooth as silk and the banana essence is not the artificial flavor you'd get from a cheap brand.

Quickly moved to Coffee People's Original Donut Shop.  Is a bit bolder.  Would consider medium, not strong.  I've since stuck with this as my daily, go-to blend.

I ordered it on the twenty-third and had it by the twenty-fifth with no special shipping options. Packaged securely. The tin itself is lovely and snug.<br /><br />The tea: I could smell the violet immediately, though my husband, who isn't as familiar with the scent, had trouble. It blends well with the scent of the tea itself, though I was disappointed to find no actual petals in it (the only reason I gave it four instead of five stars). Another reviewer mentioned it was weak, but I found following the recommended steeping time made an excellent cup of tea. I drink mine with no sugar or milk of any kind and found it to be floral and simple, not bitter or malty, with  the aroma of violets persisting with every sip.

So far he has been able to get himself out of it; if not I would discontinue use of the toy.   <br />Another thing that is kind of a peeve is that the stars start out singing the words to \\""Twinkle, twinkle little star\\"", and then start la-ing and da-ing.

Around 3 weeks or so we were able to start putting her in the newborn side of the tub.  The newborn side has a back that is slightly reclined and the infant side has a back that is straight up.  Once she is able to sit up without assistance we will start bathing her on the infant side.  The tub has a little \\""hill\\"" between the seats to prop her knees up so that she doesn't slide down.  It also has a small place behind the infant side where the three toys can be stored.  She's not big on the one that squirts water yet, but she loves the little one that sprinkles water.

7851,"Bamboozles are my absolute favorite diaper. My mom gifted us with 4 to try right after we'd started using cloth on our newborn son and we've been using them since he was 3 weeks old. He's now almost 7 months and still fits into the small size of Bamboozles.     After 6 months of use (and twice-weekly laundering on an extra-hot sanitizing cycle & mostly line drying) they're still in perfect condition- the unbleached color has faded quite white and they have no stains whatsoever. The snaps are well-positioned and these diapers can go directly from your baby to the laundry pail; no fastening of closures or laundry tabs is necessary.    They are terrific for nighttime- we've never had a leak- and even the newborn blowouts were unable to escape this diaper. On top of it all, they're cute and really soft, even after line-drying. Even when the Bamboozle is soaked, my baby's bottom remains quite dry. I like to use them with a paper liner wrapped around the sewn-in doubler for easy poop removal. For such an absorbent diaper, they are pretty trim as well.    I should mention that they are slower to dry than any other diaper that we've used (including all-in-ones), but this has not been an issue as we live in a dry climate. If you want them to be super soft (the fabric fibers are almost silky when new), use the dryer rather than a clothesline. Line drying makes them a bit rougher feeling, though this will not affect their absorbency.    These work well with any roomy diaper cover- I prefer Wonder Wraps, but also use Imse Vimse and Bummis Super Whisper Wraps.",X_test

And it is definitely a higher quality tea, with full leaves instead of fannings. I use the Takeya flash chill iced tea maker, which works well. It has a very fine mesh infuser that works for even really chopped up leaves. You obviously don't need a &#34;tea maker&#34; (I have always just used a glass pitcher, water and tea bags), but the Takeya is a fun gadget.

My newborn has been fascinated with this since she was a month old. The firefly mirror on the wing is too small to interest her even though she is now 3 months old. However, the tangling teether from the firefly should come in handy in another month or two. If you were to buy only one Lamaze for a newborn, I recommend the turtle for its nice size mirror.",X_test

7877,"Potty training is difficult enough without leaky training pants, which is just what these are. They hold virtually nothing, even when changed every hour, the littlest accidents leak right  through! My son just got through potty training last summer/fall which is where I came to know the Dappi brand vinyl diaper/underwear covers. They are awesome, holding so much I would put my son in tub to take them off. So when I came accross these Dappi Early Trainers, all in one pants, I knew they would be perfect for my 22-month-old daughter who is just starting her training. The Dappi vinyl covers were just amazing, so why would these, also made by Dappi be so different. The \\""absorbent\\"" cotton lining is extremely thin, and even as the Dappi Early Trainers are a bit snug in the legs, there is leakage from there as well as up her back, through her clothing, they're vitually useless! I have had to use a \\""Pull Up\\"" with the pants, since the only use Dappi Early Trainers have proven themselves for is a deterent against my free-spirited girl taking her diaper/Pull Up off (a favorite pastime of hers) and making even worse messes than she would with just the Dappi Early Trainer.

Yacon syrup recently became popular after it was featured on The Dr.Oz Show. The Episode that featured this product is called, &#34;Find Out Your Metabolism Personality to Lose Weight&#34;! He referred to it the “metabolism game changer”.<br /><br />The biggest changes that are decrease in my appetite and boost of energy. I don’t eat as much food as I use to and I am more active. I also tend to drink a lot more water than I usually do but I realized it's because I was taking it too much. If you do, it will give you the feeling of bloating and gas production. It's like overeating on shredded wheat cereal. Regardless, I take one (1) teaspoon three times a day by itself and sometimes with my Cream of Wheat and Health Shakes.<br /><br />I put it in my oatmeal, smoothies and I've used it for baking. The consistency is very thick and a dark brown-color like molasses. It has a smooth chocolate aroma. I really love the taste.<br /><br />Results will vary on individual circumstances. I will recommend this products to anyone that wants to lose weight.

For example, Jason Wrobel has a recipe for 'Chocolate Pecan Crunchy Balls' that's out of this world.

The flavors are subtle and pure and enhance, rather than drown, the flavors of your favorite gin or tonic.  The absence of a sickly sweetness is what makes this tonic most special, along with the mild notes of quinine and a bitterness that's just notable enough to work.  The premium for this product is worth every penny.<br /><br />Having tried it out with a number of spirits, I've found  this works especially well with Nolet's gin.

I don't know if it came from \\""my\\"" jar or from other jars a the warehouse, but it was a little annoying.  I opened it up and it was very hard on top and a little brown.  Nothing to worry, I figured.  I put the jar in some hot water and let it soak for a bit and then when I opened it, it was very liquid for the top half of the jar and still solid at the bottom.  I tried stirring it up to see if I could get it all to mix, but I really could not easily get the bottom stuff to stir.<br /><br />I thought about letting it soak longer and then I started worrying that maybe the lid wasn't on tight and I had let water into the product and that is why it was so liquidy.  I took a little bit of the liquid and put it in the fridge to see that it solidified and I was not worried about having added water...it was just the oil.  Still, it took until overnight before the product \\""set\\"" again.  I don't know what it is like half way down in the jar (where it was previously fairly hard), but the top half is now very easily scooped with a spoon.<br /><br />I mixed it up with some coconut oil and peppermint oil and honey based on a Nutiva recipe and made my own york peppermint patties (without the chemicals).  They were heavenly.<br /><br />Not sure what else I will use it for, as I think regular coconut oil is more versatile.

The stroller was very easy to put together on my own and now this is where my positives for this stroller end. There is really nothing else I like about this stroller. I own 4 strollers, this is the first stroller I ever bought that I felt like was a complete waste of my money. I bought this one because I needed a light compact stroller that I could easily take on the metro with us and that would still provide my son with a good canopy to protect him from the sun while we were walking around D.C. The canopy was awful, may as well not have even had one, the wheels on my stroller do not actually lock, that was another feature that may as well have never been added. My wheels are all wonky when pushing this thing so it was almost impossible to walk straight, I was fighting the stroller the entire time I was out, I assume that was due to the fact I could not actually lock the swivel action but even on my other stroller with swivel wheels I never have this problem. The seat seemed a little flimsy and I constantly kick this stroller when walking, I am only 5'4'' and none of my other strollers cause me to do this.

7934,"I bought this to use in my husband's truck so I would't have to shuffle my daughter's primary carseat (a Graco MyRide 65 that I LOVE) back and forth. I didn't want to spend the money on another expensive carseat so I did a lot of research and found this one.  My daughter is BARELY 20 lbs and has been rear-facing in my car (she's 17 months), but since she is technically big/old enough to go forward facing, it seemed to make the most sense to purchase a booster seat that could be used until she is big enough for a saftey belt alone instead of another convertible that only goes to 65 lbs or less and isn't big enough for a large child.  Anyway, I am no stranger to the LATCH system with this being my 3rd carseat personally and probably 6th I've installed (for family/friends), but this carseat's is by far the most difficult I've used yet.  Just the location of the lower belt being so high makes it fairly difficult to get super tight, but by sticking your body weight & knee into the center of the seat and pulling with all my strength, I got it very secure (and I'm pregnant, so you can do it with some effort).  The armrests are a bit flimsy and the drink/snack holder sits a bit tilted, but for the price, it's what I expected.  Contrary to many opinions, I quite like the length adjustment in the front although it makes for a bulky strap.  My biggest complaint is the chest clip...holy cow, that thing is seriously a challenge to get undone every time.  If I had to use this carseat every day, I would go nuts.  BUT if you have a child who can undo their own chest clip, this might be the seat for you because I know of no Hoodini child who'd be able to open this.  Otherwise, the carseat seems comfortable enough (way more than my mother-in-law's Cosco) and does what it needs to!<br /><br />Bottom line: You get what you pay for as far as luxury, but it does it's job!  Beware of the chest clip though.  Test one out at a store before you buy it to make sure you can tolerate that.",X_test

7957,"So I really like that this gate is a walk through and doesn't have to be screwed into the wall.  Beware, there are still quite a few draw-backs.  The first one is that it's difficult to install.  You twist and twist and twist all four of the touch points, and if you don't do it just right, the gate will be wonky or pop out of the wall.  My son has pulled it down several times because I cranked and cranked, but I still didn't get it quite tight enough.  Also, the two touch points on the bottom for some reason fall out of the gate when it's not installed, so if you're storing this gate or not using it all the time, it's super easy for one of those things to fall out in a closet or something, a toddler to walk off with them, and then never see them again, and then your gate is wonkier than ever.  This gate does not work at the bottom or top of stairwells well at all, but is pretty decent in standard doorways.  With stairs, it's difficult to get it level and tight between a banister and a wall, especially because banisters don't have a lot of flat space for the touch points, and secondly the step pedal often ends up not on a step, and so when you step on it, it can pull the gate down again!  It seems like now a gate that installs permanently would have been a better choice, but I got it for my mom's house so she can just put it up while we're in town and take it down for the rest of the year.",X_test

7959,"In a previous review, I warned fellow customers about the possibility that meat could be grain finished and still be labeled \\""grassfed.\\"" A representative of the company selling this meat then informed me that their meat is grass finished, and that they felt this was included in grassfed, even though regulations would allow them to more cheaply grain finish. I feel this shows they care more about customers than about just barely clearing the bar to satisfy regulations. Some companies are not so honest, and these guys should get props for that!<br /><br />On top of that, this meat is competitively priced when compared to other online retailers. However, it is not competitively priced when compared to the wide array of grassfed beef options available to most people. Check around your local area, look for farms markets, ask butchers, etc. You will likely find grassfed meat at a fraction of this price.  And you will be helping save the earth by reducing shipping long distances!<br /><br />If in the end, you can't find other options, then (from my interaction), this seller is just trying to sell healthier meat, where as some are just trying to swindle as much money as they can with misleading labels.

Even thought I had a nightmare experience with FedEx and tried the Cool brand (which is good, just more pricey and not as sturdy a bottle) and had to go back to this because it's the best of all I tried.

7967,"This bag would be good for any other purpose.. NOT a diaper bag. Other moms know you need to pack tons of just-in-case stuff in diaper bags. This bag was appealing to me because of the crazy amount of pockets inside. Well what I didn't expect was how tall and narrow this bag . So narrow that if you put something in each pocket. All of the pockets are touching each other and then there's no room to actually put anything in the large middle area. There are also pockets all around the outside, but again, they're not great. There are no zipper pockets anywhere on this bag. So basically the 2 days I used this bag, it was packed to the brim (WAY tinier than you imagine) and since it was so full, I couldn't zip it and was constantly making sure it was sitting upright because if it ripped over, everything would spill out of the middle or the outside pockets.<br />Also the quality of the fabric is not great. It feels very cheap and the straps are already starting to come apart from the bag (again, I only used it two days before I switched.)<br />Would NOT recommend this.",X_test

Overnight, if I move a lot from side to side, I'll wake up and they'll be coming out the top of my bra, but during the day I don't have that issue at all. I have had them become saturated overnight, but the plastic backing stopped from leaking out onto my nursing bra. I wear them with my nursing bra 24/7 and cried when I had to buy another brand when I couldn't find these in stock. As soon as it was back in stock I bought more and stopped using the other brand I purchased and hope to never have to use the other one again.",X_test
7971,"I normally do not write reviews for items purchased on line, but felt compelled to write one for Cafe Caribe. I read all the reviews before purchasing this item, but dismissed the negative reviews as unrealistic.  One reviewer mentioned the flavor is akin to the smell of an ashtray; I know now this is not an exaggeration.  The coffee bricks arrived promptly & well-packaged, but that was the only positive aspect.<br /><br />Cutting the brick open, there is no pleasant fragrance familiar with opening other coffee cans or bricks from Bustelo, Pilon, Lavazza, Estrella, or Gevalia.  Even Folgers coffee smells better by comparison. Cafe Caribe has an unmistakable cigarette smoke smell to it.  The roast is medium, not dark; the grind is coarse and very uneven.<br /><br />Bottom line, Cafe Caribe is cheap very difficult to drink even when masked with strong flavors and milk or cream.  It might best put to use in seasoning new Moka pots then fertilizing the rose bushes.  My advice is to save your money and spend it on Bustelo if you like Cuban coffee.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00060O578 Cafe Caribe Dark Roast Espresso Coffee, 10-Ounce Bricks (Pack of 6)]]",X_test

7978,"Yet another of my long winded reviews. Beware Ye of little attention and patience.<br /><br />Vinegar has many uses.<br /><br />A surprising and pleasurable use of the simplest white wine vinegar is to use it to soak your feet.<br />Feet which have had an unacceptable odor will become completely neutral in smell.<br />Vinegar is mildly antimicrobial and acidic. It kills the smelly bugs living on your feet and (probably, I'm not a doctor) will also help your body combat a minor cut or wound on the feet.<br />Toenail jam which normally is like cement cleans out easily.<br />The nails on my big toes can normally only be trimmed with a pair of Klein Mechanics' 8\\"" side cutting pliers are cut with the usual nail tools.<br /><br />Here's some of my details:<br /><br />You will need:<br />A comfortable place to sit tight for at least a half hour.<br />1 gallon of any old white vinegar. This may be the hardest task of this project. Surprisingly, even here in Manhattan where all people seem to do is try to get rich trading Derivatives and eat Food, it can be tough to find cheap, large plastic 1 gallon jugs of vinegar. Smaller supermarket chains usually don't stock the big jugs but I've had good luck getting them to bring them in. Getting them on Da Net is possible but the shipping kills you. \\""Pint's a pound, the world round\\"". Five dollars a gallon, delivered into my apartment, is the best I have been able to do.<br />A tub of some sort which will comfortably allow you to put both feet into. Rubbermaid makes inexpensive new ones which can be bought from Amazon. Minimum 10 - 12 gallons. Don't use some old junk tub as there will be a fair amount of water which can cause damage.<br />A smaller decanter for filling and emptying the tub.<br />A few old towels.<br />A small plastic drop cloth for good wood floors and/or carpeting.<br />Some way to determine the water temperature. A candy thermometer works fine.<br />One clean, dry towel.<br /><br />Procedure:<br />This whole thing is good to do if you have a minimum of an hour where you are parked and going nowhere. I read or do computer work.<br />Plan ahead.<br />Be very safety conscious. If there is any possibility of electricity mixing with water, then do what I do. Raise every electrical wire, splitter, computer etc which is nearby off the floor. Use short pieces of cheap 2 by 4 lumber. The higher off the floor the better. Don't be stupid. Do not ignore my advice. The medical coroner will be amused at your clean, dead feet if you don't. Do not allow this to happen. Don't be stupid. I don't think I can bang on enough about this danger.<br />My white oak flooring was nice when I installed it about 25 years ago but now its got a bunch of stains and I just don't care. If you have nice flooring, put down a little plastic in the area where you will sit. If you are a complete accident prone putz then get a larger tub to hold the smaller one (the one your feet will fit in). Tubs are cheap insurance, especially if you have other tenants living under you.<br />Make sure both tubs can hold the full amount of fluid which is a minimum of 5 gallons.<br />Keep everything you may need handy so that you don't have to go traipsing around with wet feet.<br />Put down some old towels under and around the your tub. There will be some splash when you're done and when you are emptying the tub. The tub will be at least 40 pounds of soiled water. I use a smaller decanter with yet another tub with a handle to empty the whole shebang.<br />Pour your gallon of vinegar into the tub. Room temperature is fine. I believe a minimum  ratio of 1 to 4 (1 gallon vinegar and 4 gallons of water) is fine. I acquired an old mop bucket which holds a fair amount more water. Warm water up past my ankles, very nice. The amount of water is not too important as long as you use 1 gallon of vinegar.<br />Next, you have to determine the highest temperature yo' feets can take. I have a fancy pants Fluke 65 infrared thermometer and 110 degrees (F) is about the limit of what my feet can take. Interesting, my hands tolerate much higher limits.<br />You can do a little experimentation with a simple, cheap candy thermometer to find a high limit.<br />Remember, the temperature of your tub water starts to cool down immediately. I have found it to drop 5 to 10 degrees after a half an hour which is fine.<br />Use the highest temperature you can take.<br />My faucets spews out water at about 150 to 160 degrees (F) so it's easy for me to fill the tub. You may have to heat up some water to get past 110 degrees (F). I recommend no more than 3 gallons (24 pounds) of very hot water for a single person to handle.<br />Unless I'm really bored and/or drinking, a minimum half an hour soak is perfect.<br />Maintenance on stubborn toenails is easy at this point.<br />After a soak, the whole house smells mildly of vinegar. This may or not bother you. Not much different from making a salad dressing.<br />Amazingly, if you dry your feet with a fresh, clean towel, the vinegar smell disappears by time you empty your tub.<br />If you have an ultra sensitive beezer, by all means rinse your feet in the shower.<br />You now have clean and sanitary tootsies, very suitable for further attention of all sorts.<br /><br />BTW, the first time I did all of this, an entire afternoon had disappeared. Now I can do it all in about an hour, once a week or so. It's not a bad idea to sprinkle some fancy, disinfecting foot powder into your stinky shoes every now and then.<br />I know I have droned on with cautions.
