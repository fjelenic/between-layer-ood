The main OOD detection experiments are run by running <code>python3 run.py</code>.
The OOD detection experiments using the energy method are run by running <code>python3 run_energy.py</code>.
The semantic shift experiments are run by running <code>python3 run_shifted-ng.py</code>.
The background shift experiments are run by running <code>python3 run_shifted-sst.py</code>.

After running experiments, the results can be verified and visualized using jupyter notebooks <code>results.ipynb</code> and <code>figures.ipynb</code>.
